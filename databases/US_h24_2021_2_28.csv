GME,1425,929583," the whole GME fiasco really desensitized my expectations of the market ... 20% increases or even 40% increases don’t even phase me anymore   I want to double my money in a day nowadays 😂😂 I kinda hope GME tanks the economy if only because of the absolute drama it'd cause AMC dudes are poor dudes who can’t afford GME I’ve been trying to figure out what this word ‘diversification’ means and as far as I can tell so far it means owning lots of shares of GME at different purchase prices per share I can’t wait to buy my GME shares at 300 and sell at 40.   Buy the peak sell the dip I bought $10,000 of GME about a month ago, sold it for $1,500 about a week ago (I’ve still got plenty, no worries)  Fidelity sent me a letter saying they’d put me on a margin account if I kept selling unsettled shares. No fucking idea what their problem is but my wife reads the mail so a pretty dick move  I’m in too far to start learning rules now. I have a feeling I'm going to either gain or lose a lot of money on GME next week Hey guys and gals. I dont have anymore DD than this. Last time GME was rocketing, almost all the major banks had a dip at the same time. And recovered when GME started to fall again at the same time. They are doing it again.  Puts and calls could be some free money.  E: Banks with the same trend include   JPM  C  BAC  PNC  WFC  TFC  COF  GS  FITB  CFG  E2: pretty much all of them 🤷‍♂️ $800 3/19 calls on GME cost $500 right now. Jesus Christ. $500 calls cost $1,100 The max pain value on GME is consistently above 50 for the next 2 months. I see speculation that hedge funds actually drove the price up by purchasing way ITM call options that cover double or more than their short position.  This puts the bearish position in the options sellers hands.. and now they are short gamestop for a far greater amount than the hedge funds--potentially needing to purchase many more shares than are available.  It was pretty evident that this is a gamma squeeze regardless, so whether or not it was driven by hedge funds switching to long positions is irrelevant.  This stock ain't done by a long shot. I wish GME would breakout like viruses do in America If GME reaches $1000 I'll keep on yoloing FDs until I'm poor again. Mods please make a seperate GME thread again tbh How many of you are actually holding GME? I miss the DD’s posts and comments. Now it’s just “GME AMC 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀” Should I get my dick surgically enlarged or buy more GME? I have so many theses for the market, but they all contradict themselves. WTF, I'll just buy GME. My nerves highkey frayed for Monday and GME and I’m not even gambling more than 10% of my portfolio.   I really need to stop this shit GME weekend thread plz Thanks Mods Can men make an Onlyfans account?? Asking for a “friend” in case GME fails.... AMC apes are the slightly more retarded and hunchbacked younger brothers of GME apes. My wife left me for a man who holds more GME than me. Can’t wait to make a stern call to Vlad on Monday to try and get GME buy orders restricted again Someone care to explain to me how the fuck there are currently 17,680 open 3/19 800c contracts on GME? Won't be surprise to see over $800 or under $50 on GME next week. Wall street is the best casino. Dont make money on GME and spend on bullshit ...... just kidding i need a new car 🚗 The path of the retard is beset on all sides by the inequities of paper hands and the tyranny of hedge funds. Blessed is DFV who, in the name of charity and value plays, shepherds GME through the valley of darkness, for he truly is an autist and is the finder of lost tendies. And I will strike down upon the dip with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my tendies. And you will know I am an ape when I lay my diamond hands upon you.  Ezekiel 25:17 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 Bro what is my life when I’m not staring at GME price movement all day Bought GME at 180 I need some good news We need a GME weekend thread Hate selling at a loss but thinking about selling my BB to get more AMC or GME.  Thoughts? Some lady on Monday said she'd shave half her head if GME hit 100 in the past week.   Bet Wednesday was a GUH moment for her.  Anyway -   r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltu8sl/a_bet_i_think_that_may_have_been_forgotten_about/  Hey /u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR  I don't think I saw this name on any of the lost bet posts of yours.  Any chance of checking? Why are all the news broadcasters saying GME is no longer shorted.. or sits around 40% at most?  These threads and stats suggest GME is shorted a lot more than that.. Looks like Monday menu is most awaited with AMC and GME are on top of the list 😅😅😅😅😅 Hoping we see a nice drive tomorrow get GME pushing that $200 mark! Get this, my fellow apes. Tomorrow I have my exit exam for nursing school. I graduate literally in 17 days and this exit exam is the biggest exam of the entire program. But I’m salty that I can’t watch my GME and AMC all morning while I’m stuck in this exam???!!! Ass backwards priorities lol. I haven't bought GME yet  Should I buy it now?  Please give a serious opinion😊 Also I'm from India. Waitin' for the weekly Friday GME upshoot, buying every Wed/Thurs is my move  Not financial advice, unless we're talking about the Farmer's Market. I'm definitely talking about that market. That feeling when cocaine can't even get you high after GME going from $48 to $91 in an hour after an ice cream cone tweet So, I watched this today - [Stock Markets with Bruce](https: youtu.be/VwXLRoAw3Z4) - and it sounds like this will be a never ending monthly back and forth cycle of these fabricated shares being passed around back and forth between the Hedgies and Chicago Options Exchange with each taking monthly turns at crisis management and repositioning to profit on the volatility of GME?  Someone better clued up tell me this can’t happen long term? GME  cured  my depression Prediction....  Premarket: GME @ $20, 🦍s eat all the 🍌s & 🖍s they the can grab  Market opens: GME @ $6969 and 💎🤚 🦍 go on the mythical 🚀 to the 🌙 When GME goes up AMC follows double squeeze please like my wife's boyfriend does to her!! GME has brought excitement and joy to my life.  I am a challenged retard and I love the stock. Monday is coming....... It's time to support GME and long stocks :) Let's try new high at 700 My room is blacked out so when I wake up I have no clue what time it is.  Without even thinking I look at my phone for pre-market activity on GME🚀🚀🚀🚀.  It's programmed into me.  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|put_back)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|put_back) New to the game, got 5k ready to throw down.. is this going down tomorrow with GME or what? GME makes me start to hate weekends and euphoric to stand up early in the morning. Hold GME Quick question: (I haven’t placed it) but “buy +1 GME 100 16 April ‘21 0.5 @1.00 LMT [to open]” means I’m betting the stock dropped below $100 before then correct? And it says “break even stock price 1.50” <- what does that mean too Will GME open higher then it closed? There are european stock exchanges and in frankfurt stock exchange they got GME just sayin.... I'm shaking, but it's nerves, not meth. But hey, if GME works out, maybe I'll get hooked and start eating crayons with the rest of you. Looks like a great time. Do you think this next week GME stocks will go up or go down? 🤔 Do you think this next weak GME stocks will go up or go down? 🤔 Not on etoro sadly. But I will be looking to leave after the squeeze because they stability is a joke.  (I'll be holding GME again because I like their future) Honestly smoking a joint right now and waiting for Monday. Not like weed is a drug but you know GME definitely the only thing that does it for me anymore. I'm in Australia and GME is at $1200 2mins in I asked my cat if I should buy or sell GME After doing hours of excessive research on GME, I decided to take your cat's non financial advice. Monday morning I am buying one more share to bring my grand total to 10. My goal is to buy at least two shares each month. I have a very high sell limit but realistically. I am not selling ever, I like the stock. Your cat makes a strong case for buying more GME. I think he has in side info and if not he certainly has done his due diligence. Keep him away from the cat nip during trading hours and all will be fine. One should always trust the Kitty when it's matter of GME. You've done more DD than most buying GME. That describes everything about this so called movement. Tricking people intp buying GME selling off smallest games. You idiots havent understood yet that you are getting fooled. Smart money wins and this is all but smart putting your money into a stock which is not worth more than 20$ in a good will szenario I think we are all spending to much time focusing on GME,,,, lol 😉,,, Thqt Is Adorable!  Thus I shall follow the Tao of Cat and buy more GME.  🚀🚀🚀 good point, guess gonna buy more. is this a financial advice? does the cat own any GME stocks? *sigh*  *Takes out 2nd mortgage to buy GME* THIS IS THE TYPE OF DD I SUBSCRIBE FOR ! IF THE FUCCIN CATS IN IM IN  🚀 GONNA SLAP ANOTHER 1k GME @open Monday ! 🖕 MELVIN   🦍 💪  💎 🙌  HOWS IT FEEL TO GET SQUEZZED Ur cats gonna get called into questioning at the GME hearings now I’ll have to look further into to GME as this looks highly promising. Thank you for the excellent DD! dumb cat gets it right again. Ask it if I should sell my GME for $10,420 per share or if I should hold out for $42,069 A guy on the internet showed me his wifes pussy and said buy GME so god damn it thats what i did GME AND KOSS TO THE MOON Can you please ask your advisor if I should sell a kidney to pay for some GME stock or should I buy one? That's about how people are treating GME anyways lol... voodoo and magic because screw the charts lol I recognize that GME is tendies, but GameStop is such a useless company. Why would we want to boost their stock? Is this just one giant fuck you to the hedge funds?   I would love further information in this whole debacle that’s been going on now for awhile.... You should change the slips of papers to buttons that when pressed actually YOLO your entire savings in GME or some other stock of choice. I have no idea what GME is, but I know but all these posts that I don't want to be involved This cat will go to jail for market manipulation.  And i’ll buy more GME, because of his DD and i like the stocks. Cat + GME = Reddit Point Of Singularity. Thanks CAT! just freed up 10k to dump in thans! $AMC $GME #iamnotacat I see a lot off thought went into this decision. Back and forth between buy and sell. What's most convincing is how quick buy was hit after your cat made up their mind which  tells me that your cat is confident in its decision. I'm a follower. I follow leaders who show great confidence in their decisions. I therefore will buy $GME tomorrow after such great efforts were put into this glorious video. Thank your cat for sharing. 🚀🚀🚀 $AMC , $BB , $GME , $NOK 📯 buy...bUY...BUUUY!!! 💎🙌 If GME goes up again on Monday maybe CNBC will be talking about a cat instead of an ice cream cone 🤔 Monday 8:00 AM GME all in Buy GME right meow Best DD I've seen yet on GME.  Great work. What’s that I heard that GME is blocked from being traded on robinhood? Is interactive brokers blocking as well? I just showed this to my grandma and she immediately gave me my inheritance money to put into GME. So on Monday I'll be pouring this $40 into it and watch it change my life. To the moon, boys. Should also buy up some AMC, gonna be bigger than GME We finally should finish the job. GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Gamma squeeze coming. 💎 🍑 💎 🙌. GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 GME gonna get me to start watching wrestling now lmao It’s a great stock with great potential, it’s vastly undervalued. It’s the PEOPLES stock now.   I’m not a financial advisor and as such here is some free financial advice from Europe. Investing in GME instead of meth cocaine and other drugs with your stimulus checks will extend your life expectancy.    I like the stock, Crayolas and money. In that order.  💎🙌📈📈🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 $GME going up monday morn i betcha \*GME perks up 10% in power hour\*  \*jim ross voice\* DON'T DO IT! DON'T DO IT!  \*GME shoots up 50%\*  \*jim ross voice\* MY GAWD! OH MY GAWD! FOR THE LOVE OF GAWD!  \*GME shoots up 120%\*  \*jim ross voice\* BAW GAWD! GOOD GAWD ALMIGHTY! WTF did I just, oh never mind! GME 🚀🚀💎🙌🏼 Started reading through thread and got surprised someone mentioned GME in a wrestling thread 🤣 I’ll never understand WWE, but gimme that GME anyway If you guys recall, the Hulk is powered by gamma.  Hulk got squeezed by Thanos on board the Asgardian ship.   Hulk got gamma squeezed.  By Thanos.  Thanos is inevitable.  The gamma squeeze is inevitable.  &#x200B;  JK. GME $70 EOD, $147 intraday high. This gamma squeeze will cause the short cover which will result in the MOTHER OF ALL SQUEEZES  THERE MAY NEVER BE ANOTHER SQUEEZE LIKE GME EVER fuuuuu i should’ve been watching GME i just seen it at 99$:( I remember watching this when it aired! It was so damn satisfying just like watching this $GME rocket surprise everyone 😎 Hedge funds: “And that, kids, is how GME gave me pink eye.” Buy. Buy. Hedge funds to the earth. GME to the 🌚 GME only has 40% short interest. Go for RKT instead better company you won't be holding the bag if the trade goes against you. Manage risk and tendies will follow  https: www.highshortinterest.com /Wtf what episode is this lmao. They really did this to the money guy. Also $GME to the moon. Made my day. GME IS A MEME STOCK I’ve seen outrageous posts and bets here recently, and people have lost money because they have no idea what they are doing. So, I’m just going to leave this here and post it again, or a long version throughout the week to lower this madness and save people from losing money. I honestly hope newcomers see this...  Tl;dr: STOP OVERTHINKING  Treat GME like a meme stock and buy on the dip. If you buy options, set the expiration for end of month/April. Doesn’t matter what the strike price is because of IV Crush. You can sell anytime without effecting the cause (always pay yourself, keeps your head clear). If you sell before stimmies, buy back in. Gamma is pending.   Longer version:  There will be a squeeze and a gamma squeeze this month (March). Follow the money/word of mouth. The real catalysts are social media and upcoming stimulus.   GME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks. It’s abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn’t matter what your strike price is. All that matters is the expiration. Set longer expirations for your calls/puts so you can sell whenever you feel like paying yourself and buy the shares to support the cause.   GME being a meme is not a bad thing. In fact, it’s why we can do this. You don’t need an over complicated strategy to make profit here. The stock will rise and gamma when the little people are given 600 billion dollars to invest. Hedge funds know this and will use this as the opportunity to win the war. This isn’t new information. This has been in play since January, possibly even before. Why did DFV set his calls to expire in April? Why are hedgies repositioning themselves? Why did shorties call foul play against us in January? Play it smart and safe and you won’t lose a dime and will make unbelievable profits.    Remember that we are small fish in a gigantic pond that has existed even before DFV decides to make his move. I can elaborate on this later. While we may be small fish, the great equalizer is the stimulus. Some of you don’t remember this: but shorties and hedgers cries foul play, blaming the government for giving people the power to take their profits because the stimulus gave millions of people the same buying power as hedge funds. Fueled by word of mouth, which travels at the speed of light because of social media, it created an explosion that they could not control, so they shut down the game. It will happen again.   I think people are overthinking this and coming up with convoluted plans, when all you have to do is buy and hold. Sell your options, but hold your shares. Rinse and repeat. It’s what hedge funds are doing. It’s all there if you look at the charts AND the options. Look at the whole picture and follow the money.   Cash app finally added GameStop to purchase, meaning ANYBODY can buy the stock, AND the the stimulus is on its way. Put it together. Don’t look for a made up catalyst. It’s right there in front of all of us. It happens with hertz, and it happened in January. Don’t underestimate the power of the Apes and social media.   I left a lot of things unexplained but you get the picture. Also, for those of you who are spreading the word, keep it up and ramp it up before the stimmies drop. Doing God’s work (not religious just an expression). I’ll see you all in Andromeda (galaxy far away because this is going intergalactic).   This is just my opinion, trying to save lives not give financial advise. If it sounds this way that’s interpretation.   I eat crayons and huff gas fumes for fun!  I hope all newcomers see this...  Edit: thank you all so much! I am replying to you Damn apes as fast as I can! Am I officially an Ape now? I love you guys and want ALL OF US to prosper! I left some things out like how “GameStop is a cow that produces infinite milk and that’s why shorties keep coming back to ‘squeeze’” but I thought it was implied lol my B. I was planning on making a more in-depth version of this post soon though!  Whenever you are confused and dissuaded by all the misinformation, come back here or speak my name. I’ll be there to put you back on the right path. > There will be a squeeze this month  But it’s February 28 on a Sunday  Edit: may GME moon this ~~week~~ month like the upvotes All I know is 1 GME = 1 GME the price doesn’t matter to me, I just like the stock Honestly the feedback here is awesome and I am trying to respond to as many people as I can haha! Great way to spend Sunday before market opens and I double down on some shares and calls!  I am genuinely interested to hear from all the naysayers though who don’t believe in the stock and I’m going to make a post for discussion so we can all see where these people are coming from!  Also, thank you so much for the support on my most successful post so far! I am glad so many of you are reaching out to me to learn more about how I am approaching this and how it’s possible to jump on this ship without losing money!   Of course these are my opinions and I’m only saying what I would do/have done to keep me in the green even when the stock tanked last week by utilizing options and not setting the expiration for February 28th...  Anyways, my goal is to educate. If you have a differing opinion please explain it instead of tearing people down so we can all learn and grow together!  Maybe I am a little naive and innocent to believe we are here to support one another and that we all want to prosper together... Maybe. BUT that won’t stop me from trying!  Will I make a post like this again?  Yes.   What if you get hate?  I’ll STILL EFF’NG DO IT AGAIN  There’s more positivity here than hate.   Special Thank you to those of you also answering peoples questions about the stock and how to get in! This is why the stock will surge again! If we teach people how to invest more wisely it will reduce the need to paper hand for %20-%200 and cash out options at 500%-1000%+ so they can buy more shares!  Maybe some don’t want this. I dunno. But I want to find out so we move forward again!  Also, yes I own both GME and AMC in shares and options and my options are worth more than my shares for anyone wondering and I’m BUYING MORE tomorrow! Or Friday when it dips again   Why did I make this comment long?  Sorry lol Once stimulus checks start hitting bank accounts combined with tax return season in motion a lot of that extra $$ that people aren’t used to having is of course going to help families that are struggling get by but for the people doing fairly well and still employed it is going to find its way right back into The market in one form or another especially on speculative stocks like AMC, GME, CRON, CGC etc. and everything else that a speculative investor can try and ante up on and make more money,  it’s like the casino giving out free chips to degenerate gamblers, and the so called Professional/ Career investors /HF Would argue that we don’t know what we’re doing or talking about and should not be putting money into stocks that do not make sense, I would argue what stock does make sense everything is speculation and nobody knows what the future of the company will be look at Tesla’s PE ratio most HF were dead wrong about that one and who are they to say AMC/GME Will not fully transform their business down the road With solid leader ship in place as we grow further into this digital age I think they’re just crying because the house is actually on the losing side of the trade and it’s just getting started good luck to all 🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍💎🙌🏻 PS This is not financial advice  my brain is so smooth that it resembles silly putty when it’s fresh out of the container I just like the stonks “My only regret is that I have but only one bank account to sacrifice for GME.”  -RoninBebop91 I wonder what percentage of the stimulus package is used to buy GME 😅 If you were cool buying GME at $100+ before, then you should have no problem buying GME now at $100+  But HODOR  GME to infinity and beyond! I’m from the U.K. so I’m not too clued up on the stimulus! Could someone tell me when it drops and what it means for GME? Iborrowdesk shows interest rates for GME around 9%. If I understand correctly, ETFs can be used to find extra shorts. 2?s. How does this work? And would ETF interest rates correlate with iborrowdesk's displayed rates? What are GME and AMC hitting next week?! GME is not a memestock anymore, it became harsh reality.  A meme stock is something like GAYMF (Galway Metals) What should I do with my 1k tell me because I’m an ape and I don’t know what to do ?   You can have my banana 🍌 in exchange for help. GME 2 🌙 Fellow retard is right. Cash App is now selling GME 🚀🚀. Make it launch now to the 🌚💎🤲 > GME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks.  It’s abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of  IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn’t matter what your  strike price is. All that matters is the expiration.   Either you don't understand what IV crush is, or are applying it incorrectly here. Please explain how strike price is irrelevant here to all the full retards buying 800c's My brother and I bought GME. The stock went dowm and I told my brother keep your 💎🙌🏾, sell. Hope he'll listen and trust the process... What’s your prediction for $GME on Monday? I bought a lot of shares at $143 and I am worried but I’m going to keep buying. In your opinion how long will the wait be until we see the price run up huge I will say GME options have gotten hella expensive. Buy AMC and GME  HOLD BY SUMER TIME BOTH STONK  WILL 🚀🌝🦍💎✋🏼 GME only has 40% short interest. Go for RKT instead better company you won't be holding the bag if the trade goes against you. Manage risk and tendies will follow  https: www.highshortinterest.com /I appreciate this post so much.  I've bought a few in the past but never made money. I started buying GME when it was at $294 and going down. I have averaged down to around 128 now. I was so upset cause I really don't have the money to put into the stock.   I am a 47 year old woman that has to take care of 7 People in my household, two of which are autistic and one grandson that has brain damage.  But my thinking is either this will take off and help us or I'll just continue being poor and barely scraping by.  I grew up dirt poor, and sometimes being homeless. So what ever happens it will be ok.  I now have 50 stocks in GME which may not be much to some but it is all I have. Wish I understood options but I don't.    I'm just praying that this little bit I do have will be life changing for my family. It’s so clear what I must do. [buy GME](https: youtu.be/bxqLsrlakK8) 💎🤲🏽 Buy GME! I just wonder how much money can i get from 3 GME? I see you are an inteligent ape, just need to know this as my my girlfriend housband need a new cage. How high can GME go? I don't understand these 'limits"" being referred to. When I look at the stock on CashApp, I only see a buy or sell option. I'm finally able to access GME, but I don't know where it's been sitting since last week. Is the 100$ per share high or low rn? The app doesn't really show enough data and I don't want to buy it high. I have AMC, but that was a buy and hold long-term for me. I just bought AMC to learn the process. I got on the rocket when GME jumped up the 2nd time, bought 4 shares at 130$ and then another share at 100$   Also got 25 shares in AMC.  Just waiting for Monday, if it drops some more I’ll probably put in more.  So glad cashapp let gme and amc on there. I'm starting to this that the GME meme stock and the HF war is pretty much over and is a nice narrative.  The real war now is with HF and MM's as to who can make money and not get stuck holding the bag.  Retail that got stuck holding the last bag were those who FOMO'ed in and bought high sold low (this is the way).  Also this was a fight with WSB and Citron/Melvin which pretty much already played out.  From what I have read, and researched we know there is still a tonne of SI, and it increased the last two days, the price increase was from the FTD's early in the month, but now if the HF were smart they would have bought 2x their SI of ITM calls which expired on Friday.  This passes the bag off to the MM who sold them and they have  till the 19th to deliver (as we know every one will FTD esp if they were naked).  The HF's that were short just managed to kick this down the road to the MM's, and want to keep the price inflated and rise so they make even more money exiting their SI and going Long.  I could see the MM's who now have this hot potato try to trigger a call, and force all SI's to return stock before that point forcing a squeeze, and then tanking the stock before the 19th so that all those FTD's they need to return can be bought back on the cheap, now that SI's were forced to already buy, thus sticking the HF's with lots of pretty low priced stock.  This would also exclude the HF's from shorting again as the price rises if they are the ones required to buy.  Either way it's going to be an interesting month. I will get a rocket ship emoji tattoo if GME hits $42,069 Can anybody explain options and exercising with crayons on a GME example? Most Americans are not going to use their stimulus to buy GME  Also, the rest of the world doesn’t receive stimulus checks So cash out 401k and all in GME? Done! Or new investors could just avoid this garbage. I keep seeing posts from retards like you. Your right it's a meme stock, people shouldn't touch GME with a 10 foot pole. What about AMC, will that behave like GME? Do you recommend me to put 3000$ to GME right now? GME is possibly the greatest argument against UBI that has ever been made GME will not moon until April 20 >I am genuinely interested to hear from all the naysayers though  I've been watchiong this 2nd bounce and the odd thing is that the majority of the price increases are taking place during after hour and pre market trading hours ... I just struggle to think the hedges shorting GME STILL havent covered their previous positions  What I think is actually happening is that they have put calls on the stock and are riding the growth out of hours while dumping it on the public during the day to measure feedback  Utlimately i believe they're worth at least 40-60 atm and potentialy more once they announce solid plans for the future but I'm very weary of the people behind the pump and worried for some of the guys here who may be left bag holding You will be able to tell when GME goes to the moon. Is the HF on the losing side or have they been buying the call positions to cover their shorts and profit because eventually the MM will have to buy up GME when the HF start excercising? I’ve also noticed whenever someone points out that there are bots here supporting GME (obviously along with those slamming it and propping up silver or some other bullshit), their comments are getting removed.  Also seems sus. In theory, it could, as it breaks down to a supply and demand. The 'issue' is, that everyone that is holding a position in GME has their own *life changing value*. For some involved, the price hitting 10k per share wouldn't change much in their life as they've already got a million+ in their account(s), so they've got less to worry about in regards to the volatility of the price.   Whereas someone that makes 40-50k a year and lives paycheck to paycheck, being able to turn 2k (savings) into 30k is potentially life changing.  It's all about perspective, and based on the net worth range of investors involved, if the price hit anywhere north of 1k per share, there would be a lot of sell-off, in my opinion. How much the sell-off of the 'little guys' (someone owning a few shares/contracts) would actually affect the price is unknown.   No one knows your personal finances better than you. The best thing anyone can do, is only risk what you're willing to lose and set a personal, realistic goal with profit expectations. IE: paying off a specific debt... Buying a new car.. Paying off school loans.. Etc. I’m like waaah? Lol  Most important things to keep in mind:  With options you only lose what you put in.   You only go negative if you margin/borrow.   IV is key and pays you more than owning the stock (IV=implied volatility)  Sell the contract, you don’t have to exercise it.   You can sell your contracts at anytime you choose. You have full control here.   GME wise:  You can sell options AND diamond hand shares   You do not own stocks, only rights.   You are selling a contract not shares  DO NOT diamond hand options. I beg of you! Only diamond hand stocks.   Pay yourself with options so you don’t have a moment of weakness and fodl your shares.   If you do this right, you can diamond hand, and hold, and never lose a penny :)  Is this still a casino? ;D It won’t rise as high as GME BUT it is still a MEME stock and will squeeze too. At the same time! :) I’m already invested in both and I’m up thousands because I bought the shares a couple weeks ago. I bought the calls and puts expiring in April and it’s carrying my entire portfolio to the moon (even after the dip)  Edit: I haven’t lost any money and I’m still up. You can do this too :) I think you are focused too much on the shorts and not on the hedge funds who are also betting with us (not for the cause, but because they have been squeezing GameStop long before DFV got involved). GME is a meme stock. It does not operate the normal stocks do. It’s demand randomly surpasses its supply and that’s what causes spikes. What will cause the squeeze is the enormous demand pending after mid March while the stock is STILL shorted. Let me put it this was way:  You are a hedge fund and shorted gme. You are also a hedge fund and bought calls knowing the stock will rise because of a sudden movement that is driving demand through the roof. You wager that you can make money on the rise AND the dip this way. Why else do you think the the hedges jumped back in? GameStop is the company that produces infinite milk as long as you “squeeze” the udders (pun intended). They have been doing this for years. It won’t stop till the gamma squeeze happens.   I’m not telling you to buy the stock. I’m just explaining in simple terms why you SHOULD. :) Thanks for your input 25 day old account. You fuckers are spawning in like mushrooms and seem to have more and more to say against GME. The fundamentals havent changed at all, you cant scare apes into selling with this bullshit. The ones who were gonna sell already got out anyway, good luck convincing the diamond hands Oh boy this a complicated and possibly loaded question for me... some people don’t like the fact that I’m teaching people how to invest safely...  Short answer, it depends on what brokerages or trading apps you use. They all use different UI. What you have access to depends on where you live too.   So, you sign up for a trading account, either through your bank (if they have one), or a website or app that doesn’t have a negative history (just ask and people will tell you which ones are good).   You enable options and then you go to YouTube and watch people spell out how options work.   Here’s a video I used to get started: https: youtu.be/7PM4rNDr4oI  You can also read some books and articles to learn pros and cons (this takes time).   Here’s a quick breakdown though  Most important things to keep in mind:  With options you only lose what you put in.   You only go negative if you margin/borrow.   IV is key and pays you more than owning the stock (IV=implied volatility)  Sell the contract, you don’t have to exercise it.   You can sell your contracts at anytime you choose. You have full control here.   GME options wise:  You can sell options AND buy and diamond hand shares   You do not own stocks, only rights.   You are selling a contract not shares  DO NOT diamond hand options. I beg of you! Only diamond hand stocks.   Pay yourself with options so you don’t have a moment of weakness and fodl your shares.   If you do this right, you can diamond hand, and hold, and never lose a penny :) They are both going to the moon. I’m invested in both and I’m waaaay up with them as well. GME is giving me higher returns but AMC is profitable as well with a lower buy in. I think this is also why it will moon too! Us poor have no money  House approves stimmie (not pictured: senate needs to approve stimmie), Fed printer go BRRRRR  Soon poor have stimmie  Poor put stimmie into stonk  Ape watch GME rocket to moon Us poor have no money  House approves stimmie (not pictured: senate needs to approve stimmie), Fed printer go BRRRRR  Soon poor have stimmie  Poor put stimmie into stonk  Ape watch GME rocket to moon You are quite the smooth brained ape. You are all over the place.  You praise robinhood...you say GME is a meme stock and doesn't function like a normal stock...then you say do a lil DD. How the fuck do you do ""a lil DD"" on a stock that doesn't function properly. You didn't give anyone a piece of any puzzle. You brought nothing to the GME game.  Lemme guess you're 18 with 3 shares When you sell there do they also only offer you like 3 dollars cash or 4.20 store credit for your GME stock Please don’t actually buy options because someone on Reddit told you “it’s easy”. Option trading is connected to a way larger risk then regular stock trading.  My advice to you is this: Find something you don’t understand? Look it up on investopedia. Still don’t understand it? Look for more sources, preferably for ones that published their article BEFORE the whole GME thing started. But most importantly, it you actually don’t understand it then DO NOT ENGAGE WITH IT.  Honestly, trading on margin/leverage without understanding the underlying risk is pretty stupid. You can amplify your losses by quite a lot (gains too, obviously).   https: www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012  https: www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-premium.asp  Blabla, obvious non financial advise, just advocating for looking up shit. Don’t sell any GME shares you fucking retard. It’s not on everyone’s radar this time though. When it happened in January, it was. I had artists on Twitter who know nothing about money aware of it and I explained what’s going on. That was the peak of social media awareness. We don’t have that this time, nobody out of the loop like that is aware we’re doing this again. So I’m predicting that the rest of the market will go up this week and GME will fall back to its old low or even lower by Friday.  But it will rise again, later in March or April. (Tax refunds, anyone?) We don’t have the awareness this time to keep this squeeze jumping. We already lost 50% of the volume from Thursday to Friday, (150 million to 92) and the options driving this surge have all expired, everything above $101 is out of the money and expired worthless Friday.   TLDR: hodl, it’s going down this week. Buy, and wait for the next round in late March or mid April.  TLDR: $100 is not the new floor, it’s going to fall and lose steam again but it’s going to spike again.  Edit: your downvotes are your own need for confirmation bias in the echo chamber. Hope you are dreaming GME 🚀 I had a reddit account over 1 year old and I thought I was a bit addicted over lockdown so I deleted it. Then one fatefull day in January I relapsed and was looking on reddit not logged in so I happened to see GME trending. Somehow I got sucked in and made a new account and then put all my money in GME lol. Also made a new reddit acccount with an appropriate name. Not financial advice, but I purchased 800$ calls expiring April 16 for $82 each (not possible anymore due to IV Crushing) it’s more expensive now. Honestly, buy any call expiring in April and you will be fine. Buying the ones that expire end of March is cheaper though. Like I said, the strike price doesn’t matter; you just need to own some options. It’s going to go waaaaaay up as stimmies get closer. This raises the premium and is how you make profits. The price of GME DOES NOT MATTER. It’s how how the demand is that makes options profitable.   Tl;dr buy the cheapest ones you can find that expire after March 19th-April 16th  Seriously though, I am a dumb ape and this is not financial advice ;) This is Gold.....which i will use to sell and buy more GME F-ing hilarious. Top 5 GME meme hands down Europoors? My country (Norway) is richer than yours, that's why I can afford to put so damn much money in GME. And we don't have 25 trillion dollars in debt and keep borrowing money from China to survive. Luckily I have AMC & GME too next to BB, so I can grab on to the rocket when it just leaves our atmosphere 🚀🚀🚀🦍💎🙌 Well looks like instead of paying these bills, that 1400 is going straight to GME stocks. Call me a retarded ape, because this guy is a 280 GME bag holder. It’s a great stock with great potential, it’s vastly undervalued. It’s the PEOPLES stock now.   I’m not a financial advisor and as such here is some free financial advice from Europe. Investing in GME instead of meth cocaine and other drugs with your stimulus checks will extend your life expectancy.    I like the stock, Crayolas and money. In that order.  💎🙌📈📈🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 We need to spread more about GME stock. Many redditors know about it but still there are people who are unaware. Let's bring them to buy the stonk.💎🙌🚀🚀🐒🦧 Honestly some of the GME memes have gotten a little old to me, because they are missing something... I think I found what it was missing. I'd gold you but I already blew it all on my little shares I bought... pretty much stealing crayons from my restaurant until my next check at this point Is this a trailer of the movie they are making about the GME saga? Should have put the GME label on the AK-420.69, I mean, 47. That’s some GME right there Just wait until apes get stimulus and income tax back. My wife's boyfriend said I could spend both on GME After GME moons I am going to go up to wife's boyfriend and say 'Look at me, I am the boyfriend now'. We need to spread more about GME stock. Many redditors know about it but still there are people who are unaware. Let's bring them to buy the stonk.💎🙌🚀🚀🐒🦧🐒 I believe unemployed young guys living at their moms will spend a large part of their stimulus to buy the PS5, a better comp rig with the intention of coding or spend it on GME stocks. All are good news for gamestop Also plenty of people doubting how high this can climb.  GME to $120,000 is not a meme. Not a penny less! By little shares; roughly GME 4.6 @ $82 average... this whole thing got me to be a little less frugal. I used to mess with trades for the last 3 years to test. I kept myself well up mostly, but I'm tired of playing it safe or ""smart"". I have a rumbly in my tummy the kind tendies can only satisfy. $GME DP! 😂  Buy the dip, not the tip! $GME it is, thank you! Boomers holding 4,000 shares and NOT paper handing is what’s gonna send GME to the thousands. Be strong daddy retard, we need you. This boomer grandma has two shares that she is holding tight. I couldn't sit this revolution out, even if I didn''t have that much to invest. I have been asked about cookies. I do bake excellent cookies and will bring them to Mars. Seriously, I have been having more fun with GME and reading on WSB than I can remember.  My 27 year old son thinks I'm nuts Another boomer here! Up to my old wrinkly nuts in GME and HODLing 💎 ✋. Because why do my kids need university when I can take them to the moon 🚀? Lost my job in 2008 thanks to these hedgies, so I want to kick Melvin in the bollocks. Plus being a part of this makes me feel young! Do you ever wonder if some of these people that are “buying GME stocks” are actually just using a stock simulator app? Cash in all your kush pensions and buy GME. It’ll be the first step towards the decades or pillaging everything you see Dude believed in Pfizer’s product cause of their boner pill but decided to sell all those shares and yolo on GME. I only came to WSB a few weeks ago for the $GME tips and to find the express lane to bankruptcy.  I’ve stayed because of posts like this and the brotherhood of the  🦍🦍.  Totally worth the drained bank account and a lot less stressful than watching the news. I was looking at the OTM call options and there are calls at $40 that expire on next Friday..... each call cost you $10 but the rewards if it goes up this week (which it will) is enormous... if you put $20 and the stock goes to $40 by Wednesday those $20 can become over $1,500..... if it goes higher you make more..... best part is that you can sell those at any prize if it’s higher then what it is now and make money if it goes lower then you only lost $20  I just noticed that this is a GME threat.... the calls I mentioned were for AMC, my bad 🤦‍♂️ I’ve been going back and forth seeing all the DDs Lmao imagine 65 year old boomers selling $2.5MM of VTSAX to YOLO GME You can't spell gnomes w/o GME Yolo’d $25k worth of GME options betting it hits $800 this week. Payout of $1.7M+ Everyone in here complaining about ‘it wont hit 800 idiot’ is fucking retarded.  It doesn’t need to hit 800. It just needs to go up.   Bought multiple options on gme 10 days ago, mostly 800c (totaled around $750), sold thurs for $15k. GME price was only at $150.  Proof: https: imgur.com/a/stbZJqY seems like the only people who make money on GME are those who sell options This is hands down the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen! You can call it balls but even if you cash out with 1.7 mil you will lose it all within 5 years bc anyone who makes a decision like that has serious problems. Unless, 25k is like a drop in the bucket for you? I don’t know your situation, but let’s assume it’s a significant amount for you. Perhaps life altering if you lose it? Use your head man! Take your 25 k and at least do something sensible. For example you coulda taken $16,700 and out it on those same options... taken the rest ($8,300) and just bought GME stock. If it gets to $800 you’ve made $1.2mil on your two orders. If it falls short you still have the stock and can get your money back if it just reaches $300 per share!!!! This is sheer stupidity. Good luck. I honestly hope you hit it and then have a dramatic change in your decision making. It’s depressing seeing all these cry baby posts about how people ruined their lives with a dumbass gamble.   This is not advice. I’m not an advisor and not a professional. Just a guy who can do basic elementary math... Dude wtf how dumb are you. Like I love your ambition don’t get me wrong but I was watching these hardcore and they were as low as $.90. How did you justify a buy at $4.17?  Tbh I’ll prob follow your trade on Monday but sec guy is speaking tues prob gonna shut GME options down for a bit. Everyone in here is talking shit about OP without realizing that GME could, in reality, hit $800 this week. This stock is volatile as hell. There are many big players in the game, from whales to institutions. Is this a YOLO? Yes. Is it regarded? Undoubtedly. Could it actually pay off? Yes, it could.  Also maybe 25k is fun money for OP, who knows. This sub is full of rich people. Came for GME. Stayed for loss porn. Damn GL bro. I know I'm buying GME on Monday. Can't risk it now that this guy is YOLOing. Though I would have bought some NIO calls then parlayed that into GME/AMC. I will get GME tattood on my ass if this pays out you crazy fuck. While I read through this thread my brain somehow replaced GME with TSLA and I was thinking “$800 is totally doable”. But then my eyes did a double take. It appears GME will be making new APE millionaires in 2021. Smooth brain power! Holding my two shares waiting to buy after the stimi news. Rocket fuel!!! So am I missing something, or is OP big retard.  Calls at the @$800 strike aren’t worth anything unless the stock clears above $800. Even if that happened by 3/5 and GME closes above $800 on 3/5, his break even is $804. Meaning he doesn’t get anything close to 1.7M...  To clear 1.7M GME would have to close above $1100 by Friday...  What am I missing? Wait payout of 1.7mm how? Like if it hits 800?? Are you fucking serious??  Edit: I was asking if you were serious because of how fucking stupid the claim of 1.7mm potential profit is. You won't even get your money back. You'll start Monday down even more because of Theta decay. You're a fucking idiot and you deserve to lose money. This isn't even a good or entertaining YOLO, there are so many better ones. Fuuuck these GME fucks are gonna give me an aneurysm. Some are not realizing a possible scenario in which a gamma squeeze hits early next week. If GME goes over $300 by Tues, the 800 strike will be profitable. Then OP ~~should~~ must roll position to a further date. Cheering for you OP On the flip side, due to the time decay you have a good chance of selling covered calls and keeping your premium.  If it actually hits you still get an 8x bagger from $100-$800.  Not a bad play, but I wouldn’t cover my entire GME position.  Leave some shares for the moon shot. RemindMe! 5 days “did this retard print money with GME $800c 3/5 FDs?” Remember when us retards saw GME go from $400 to $280 to $120 to $60   the red days passed day by day, and left us wondering is this the end? I literally could have invested in anything else would have lost less money than holding GME tendies at $280  I can recall thinking is $60 the price floor? Surely theres support at $50 he said. The dream of a $5 GME dividend to save the world. All the apes made noises.  But Bruce said GME $80 was a good buy right?! The tendies were looking juicy, and then $39 came and said fuck you I’m your stepsister’s  wife’s boyfriend.   now this is our redemption. we put our money where are brains should be. Short interest is at 9% or something. I have less than 6 inches left.   170 is Halfway there. $400 is a ticket to the heavens. $800 is a mere pitstop. the refuelling that will come in the 1000’s will bring great joy to DFV, Melvin will have to offer his wife.   watch bruce lee or something in the meantime and channel your inner retRd. for the end of this week is coming. and we are eating food or water. Your betting that GME will to 800. My my senses say maybe not. Good luck![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote) But the month of February is over. GME did see an end-of-the-month spike just like January.   If we follow patterns, GME should settle down as the shorts have time to cover scaring out weak longs before the next bloodbath at the end of March.  Amirite? Buying 50 more GME Monday morning Can someone explain this to me. Does it mean that he has the option to buy GME stocks at the current price only if the price reaches $800 a share. Also is 3/5 the time limit. I bought some of that same call friday morning when it was worth about $3. I saw my position drop from 5k to 2.5k in the span of an hour. I kept averaging down until I had 17 calls. Then it shot back up to $3 and I sold. I saw it had reached over $4 and kicked myself for selling so early. I used the rest to buy shares of GME. Options give me a heart attack.   Oh wait, I kept 1 contract. How do you even take a position that far out of the money.   TD Ameritrade wants something like $700 for one contract that's in the money on GME. Listen up newfaygits - THIS is what made WSB great before you came to crash the degenerative nature of this place with your 20 GME shares. Did no one notice that when this screenshot was taken, GME is at $2.13? IV crush like a motherfucker. He'll be down 99% by Wednesday if GME hovers around this area. I seriously am starting to think all of this GME movement is created by market makers shitting on the little guys.   It’s hilarious because they all agree and ape defend these Down syndrome ass plays. Great job OP! You’re doing the best if the goal is losing the game His math is off. Best I could guess u/allbetsonick used http: opcalc.com/qbB to calculate and looked at what the value would be at EOD on the 28th, but that’s tomorrow and the markets closed, each day with an expiry so close they are going to be worthless real fast unless we it rocket. Monday it has to be $170 ($70 jump) the first day to break even. Not trying to be a cynic I am on the GME train to but good luck He bought it for $4.00.  GME could gain 50% per day every single day until Friday and this contract would still lose value through theta decay.  He could have easily spent that exact same amount on a call at 500c and 400c (or longer Expiry) and had some type of realistic luck happening but this is just smooth as fuck brain play to do this on a weekly. He did.  I was confused on the ""avg cost"".    The odd of GME reaching $800 is so high and so soon is almost like buying a lottery ticket.  So it made sense to me that OP only paid $250.  No one paid $25K on a $1.7m jackpot. The fear is missing out on the squeeze in the middle of the week, but it seems that ending the week over $800 to require all calls to be assigned is the catalyst we need.  I just don't see how it's possible GME will end the week over $800, because you basically need one squeeze to create another squeeze, and our corporate overlords just seem unwilling to let that ever happen. ya since when did this sub become a place for *shareholders* telling each other that they are ""owners of the GME stock""   fuck that, options only I'm brand new to this. Thetagang sounds interesting but I heard they sometimes use crayons to color pictures and I'm more into using them as snacks.  My take is, fair market value is the price a willing buyer and a willing seller would each agree to each having the relevant facts and neither being forced to act.  Ignore the relevant facts bit because the market is obviously not transparent.  But there's enough dumb retards like me that I can assume there's enough that know the same as me (almost nothing).  Therefore, the amount I pay for a call option is fair market value. Somehow, the premium is supposed to represent the likelihood that a stock will soar PAST the strike price.  So if I paid $5 for a $500c 3/5, the FMV goes up if the situation changes between now and then, such that it looks any more likely at all. Even just a good little rally ($20 -$30 maybe in a short time), anytime during the week, or a couple days where it closes even a bit higher and the fair market value has increased. I made my first ten bagger (and my first sale) last week on a much smaller position and now I'm gambling with some of that money on this retarded play.  It's no yolo for me though-and I could have made a 50 bagger if I had held just a little longer. But making ten times was fun.  100 gme @ $103ish  And 1 GME $500c $5 3/5 <-retarded move. But sure will be fun if we have a week like last week and if we have a real rally? This will pay off all my gme so I can gamble more. I hate GME but I bought it for FOMO I think I'm a retard now. I'm impressed, but all that moolah spent to create this could've been spent on GME All that i see is GME will i also become GME ? I just love it.... honestly and from the bottom of my heart, and I don’t even hold any GME. Fuck GME AMC has more potential did you notice how they also take into account the environmental effects of GME going to the moon? that cloud just dropped out of existence.      What have we done?! Can't wait for GME to moon so OP can afford this 🚀🚀🚀 GME up to 800: by next Thursday GME to 800 next week and AMC to 100 the week after Monday is coming, stimmy is coming, GME is coming GME is the stimulus GME TO THE MOON!!! ROUND TWO LETS GO 🚀🌕 So long after we’ve all made our GME millions then Wondering where to set your sell limit for GME? Worried about missing the squeeze? Please read. First off, welcome to Wendys! Where our advice isn’t financial, and our burgers are stuffed with crayons!  I’ve been watching people recently scream *100K IS NOT A MEME* into the void over and over again, so I decided to break out of my lurker shell for those of us wondering if 100k is actually a meme, aren’t sure where to set the sell limit, and are afraid they are going to miss the train to tendie town. If you’ve been wrinkling your forehead thinking about this hoping a wrinkle will transfer to your brain, this is the post for you.  I’ve pulled some numbers from the Volkswagen squeeze to hopefully give some comfort to those apes who (like me) wandered around completely lost about where to set their sell *(gasp)* limits. I know GME isn’t Volkswagen, but if somebody can find me a closer comparison, that would be great!

Go take a look. *EVERYBODY!*  I’ve pulled numbers from the chart, I know they don’t line up with the values from 2008 (stock split maybe?) but they are accurate when used relative to one another.  Here we go.  October 2nd: $263  October 3rd: $277  October 6th: $292  October 7th: $287  October 8th: $294  October 9th: $296  October 10th: $342  October 13th: $353  October 14th: $352  October 15th: $390  October 16th: $398 (High $428, Low $382) --> **NOT THE SQUEEZE**  October 17th: $358  October 20th: $277  October 21st: $242  October 22nd: $243  October 23rd: $229  October 24th: $210  October 27th: $520 (High $635, Low $324) --> **SQUEEZE**  October 28th: $500 (High $500, Low $471) --> **SQUEEZE**  October 29th: $517 (High $607, Low $491) --> **SQUEEZE**  October 30th: $500 (High $590, Low $485) --> **SQUEEZE**  October 31st: $499 (High $548, Low $472) --> **SQUEEZE**  The stock then trades around $400 for almost another 2 weeks before starting to make its way back down towards pre-squeeze levels.  *BEFORE THE SQUEEZE*, the price ramps up to a peak on October 16th of $428, before crashing down over the next 6 days back to a low of $210.85 on October 24th, at which point the squeeze squozes. Once squozen, it squozes for **5 DAYS**. If the price rises and crashes fast, it *wasn’t* the squeeze.  *Please!* Put away your fears that you are going to miss the squeeze. If we get to the true squeeze, you’ll have time to take a nap and still not miss it. Even if you went on vacation for a week perfectly around the Volkswagen squeeze, you’d still have almost 2 weeks to sell at ~80% of the squeeze average.  Is 100k a meme? I have no idea - but it *doesn’t matter*. The BEST way for us to get the HIGHEST price is to completely delete your sell limits, and wait for the squeeze to squoze. That way we all get the best price, and we don’t risk scrubbing the launch before take off. In addition, the HFs can see your sell limits, and will use whatever information they can against us. Just delete them.  Absolute worst case scenario is that you’re in a coma for the squeeze, and Papa Cohen drives you all the way to tendie town.  Now, (looks around) where is that lurker shell I crawled out of.  **TLDR**: The train to tendie town doesn’t just fly by and force you to jump off a moving train. The train **STOPS** at tendie town for a vacation. The best way to get the highest price is to delete your sell limits and wait for the squeeze to squoze.  *Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do whatever you want.*  <Insert rocket ship emoji>  Position: >0, <69.75M @ >$0, < $483 Could someone play devil's advocate and elaborate on what tricks Melvin and citadel have to stop it from going up. I dont imaging they are sitting in the office twisting thumbs and doing small prayers saying ""GME please dont squeeze, please don't squeeze...""  I can imagine the exchange will halt trading again once it reaches 300 due to some bullshit reason. Blocking retail brokers from trading while clearinghouses and market makers can shuffle around with the price to mitigate the squeeze. Thanks. This is very important information for me as the proud owner if 1 (one) GME. I will hold till squoze. Great info man , it must take so much time to prepare all this shit. I for one am a grateful holder of the GME stock, thanks to all this time an effort it takes someone to give all these retards the information! I have $10k I wanna throw at GME. Should I dollar-cost average or go lump-sum when the market opens tomorrow?  Sorry I just came out of my lurker shell for this 😂 Christ, every time i see someone compare GME to VW I wanna shoot myself in the head. Is it also safe to say that we shouldnt be getting too fixated on looking at patterns or similarities between GME and VW because until the squeeze has squooze, it is still a game of green vs red as usual? $420.69 was the original meme sell point that nobody thought the stock would ever reach.    VW was a completely different situation people should really stop comparing it to GME. Stop comparing this to the VW squeeze. It is not the same. During the VW squeeze Porsche, a single entity, held the vast majority of shares. They didn't have to rely on anyone, they were not selling, period.   If you convince yourself this is a team sport you are going to get burned. Yes the GME tradable float is small, yes that is important. But if you really think WSB and Reddit owns the majority of the shares and is absolute in their resolve you are delusional. Every smart individual who has stake in this trade is going to look out for themself first if this thing starts to moon. Everyone has a unique situation and a price. If you sit patiently thinking this thing is going to trade at the moon for a week, you might get burned. People will sell and there will be more liquidity than the VW squeeze, the price will likely be volatile.  I don't say this as FUD or a shill. I say this a caution to people drinking koolaid in an echo chamber riding more money than they can afford to lose. I say this as someone holding the entire rollercoaster from low to high back to low. This is not a team sport. Period.

What Grandma say, I do 💎🤲🏽  Edit: I Yolo’d $30k at $100 when I already had $110k in GME and some people think I’m the smoothest of them all... well, it looks like we’ll find out soon enough. I don’t have a sell limit either. Same. I have 1 GME. Had a sell order, but now deleted it. Interstellar travel from my profits or broke. 🍌🍌 GME to INFINITY and BEYOND!!! It’s so misleading to people. GME went from 4 to 400. Way higher percentage gain than VW I have a real problem, because I envy all of these heavy hitters when I look at my 1 GME and 10 AMC stocks by comparison, and then I realize that it's just awesome that I get to be a part of this.   But also when we get to tendie town I'm gonna hit you up for cash. Yes they tried to put blame on wsb pulling the antisemitism card. That was deflected. Then they tried to redirect attention to silver, then try to say it's already over. You Should better sell.  Next they will try to do is blame wsb for disruption, market manipulation, blaming wsb for other stocks crashing, trying to get the SEC in there.  So I expect media attacks for sure.  There was a post earlier of several short squeezes that happened in history, and in each event either the party that cornered the stock made a compromise to sell the stock at a reasonable price or they halted trading and forced them to come with a price to resolve the issue.  So if GME shoots up with momentum and looks like it's going to blast through the to 300-400 level, they will pull the plug, halt trading to kill the momentum and prevent the short squeeze from shooting up to infinity.   That's when you know you got them cornered. If after they resume trading and nobody sells and everyone goes full Spartacus demanding 42069 per share it's going to be a moment in history which will define the stockmarket for the future. (If Melvin declares insolvent and the clearing house too, dtcc is left holding the bag) Yep! Saw that  I feel that’s their opening shot to begin their “precedent” of BS like “oh noes this is happening everywhere, GME is the same” and then use that to issue a 10 day trading suspension on GME theres a huge difference between what GME has become and a fucking load of pennystock pump and dumps (apparanelty being done through social media) VW were worth more than GME tho. Honestly, I think you cant compare VW and GME...every squezze is unique *bitch noises*  I drink your GME We left our wives, and their boyfriends too  To see this GME thing through  And squeeze the hedgies' ballsacks blue  Then take our gains and go I would literally rewatch this entire movie if it has GME subs. This post like GME should go to the Moon. They're likely long on GME now too and going to get tendies like the rest of us, to ease the pain had a dream today that GME reached 43k and i was still holding... Who the fuck has 5 minutes to watch a GME short squeeze gif? Me after selling GME last time:  ""I've abandoned my child.  I'VE ABANDONED MY CHILD!""  It  will be all over for game stop holders, again, very soon. **It's a matter of when, not if, the price will plummet again**.

And finally, in case you missed it or were just incredibly naive, seems like I'm not the only shill on reddit. **At least I'm human, and the ratio of bots pumping gamestop for every rational  bear is probably 20:1.** There are thousands of bots pumping GME on twitter, reddit, FB and probably elsewhere:  [https: finance.yahoo.com/news/thousands-bots-may-played-role-200934785.html](https: finance.yahoo.com/news/thousands-bots-may-played-role-200934785.html)  Don't worry about the usual insults, never cared anyway and I'll just assume your a bot anyway. Good luck to all fellow retards, put and call holders alike.  Your Resident (Human) Shill. This is the darkest GME meme yet WHEN GAMESTOP HITS 10K a share ILL GET A GME FACETAT UNDER MY EYE BRILLIANT! Praying it's done in TRIPLICATE; GME, AMC, NOK. Bring us littles with you. We're fun too! 💎💖🙌😂💖💎 Dude lmao I was just watching this scene two days ago thinking man it'd be cool if someone made a GME meme with it lmaooo Anyone find a WSB yummy meme circa ~2016-17 of the boy from Sixth Sense revealing to his mom in the car that he's YOLOing a bunch of options after bullshitting his way through Robinhood verifications/restrictions?  I gave it a little hunt and didn't secure the goods.  Edit: Looks like haupt91 made an updated version a month ago for GME. We need to spread more about GME stock. Many redditors know about it but still there are people who are unaware. Let's bring them to buy the stonk.💎🙌🚀🚀 Sooon may the wellerman come, to bring us GME and BB'C' and AMC (hey) They never want another GME! LOL And they are right. There won't be. $GME is a legend. Can't copy it. There will never be another GME! Is it possible? That electric vehicle manufacturer climb after the stock split but stayed up. It's going down now though. But could there actually be another movement like the GME? Well they pay me in GME stock? How stupid are they? These guys have so much money they let their entire brain go into fully mush atrophy. If they want to find next GME just look at the securities they are extensively shorting, no? They have all the answer and are still struggling to trade against retail. Pathetic. Why do we all not just trade together and take money from the FED? No there won't. There might be another huge flaw in the market with the potential GME has, but it won't be in the same way. & I doubt even that first premise. Regulators are gonna be scrutinizing the market with a magnifying glass to make sure the likelihood of anything this volatile & potentially disastrous occurring again is low...I think. LOL, I just bought 40% of what i could buy, and now over the weekend I earned alot of tendies trading internet money, can't wait till monday to buy more of $GME and $AMC with my internet tendies.... TLDR they are fucked Hedge funds might be relying on making the squeeze so big that they don't plan on covering.  Personally that's my opinion.   They want to make it worse because that way it would ruin the system. So in the meantime they will take profits on the up and down. But come time where they can't keep suppressing the price as easily,  they'll jump ship and hope the SEC will shut it down.   Just my theory.   GME to 800+  225@122.47 Will average down even more come Wednesday Mutual fund ownership of the GME stock is now closing on 4000%.  https: www.msn.com/en-us/money/stockdetails/ownership/fi-a1tyxm  AMC is at 3000%.  GME earnings is coming March 24th. This will be interesting. I wish i could read, but buy GME yes? 🙌💎 Correct me if I’m wrong but retail cannot short GME right? I can’t short it on webull.  Position = long 26 shares at 147 average (rip) The volume vs float vs amount of SI is what hasn’t made sense to me since the big January move. What’s stopping hedge funds from exercising ITM calls (at 2x their short position) at a strike well below market thereby covering their short and taking a long position? In this scenario, the market makers in Chicago would be the ones scrambling to find shares to deliver, not the hedges. Anyone have thoughts on this possibility or is my brain as smooth as a marble?  My position: 500 shares of GME, holding till valhalla  (Reposted from another thread in hopes of discussion) In for 5 will just keep buying more, take my grandkids there almost everyday day love the store need some golf get warm buy GME, most of us our ready this is no dress rehearsal What makes you think the bad guys with the dirty tactics haven't already unloaded their positions, changed sides, and are now working to send GME to the moon? Not disputing GME is a buy but where are all these numbers coming from? Short volume was 33, not short-sales. Short volume includes all transactions (new shorts, old shorts covering etc). I have 3200.00 of dry powder waiting and ready to add more GME.  Why, cause I like the stink! The conditions have changed.     Originally the short positions were ALL under water. As the stock rose, say from $4 - $40, 140% of the float was short. If you were, for instance, 1,000,000 shares short at $4... You now were $40,000,000 upside down.      The HEAVY options activity back in January meant that call writers needed to hedge their risk as the price rose. There was one day it went from $20-$30 (50%) and then $30-$40. As that happened the likihood of those options expiring in the money became more realistic and the call writers needed to go get the shares in the case they had to deliver them to option owners. It literally was a BOMB waiting to explode.      Add in the WSB retail interest, the low float, and you had a catalyst for the stock to ONLY GO UP. Literally. An amazing historical moment in the history of finance.      After the wednesday when the price spiked from $60-$120 we saw a lot of profit taking and a lot of shorting at $120. This crashed the price to $60. This is the first moment that some new shorts entered at $120. Those positions were now healthy at $60.     Despite this, most shorts and most of the shorted float was still REALLY underwater big time. The big shorters were being margin called. As they were margin called they began selling blue-chips and their main holdings to get liquidity, this is why the market dipped big, and some shorters were margin called and liquidated- forced to close their positions.      So then the price went north of $120, now ALL shorters are under water again, and likely some started buying call options to hedge if this thing went up more. This actually exasperated the problem and made it more likely to go up due to call writers hedging.      So add in: 140% short float, margin calls, volatile stock, a lot of call options ITM, retail interest and WSB hype, PLUS big hedge funds were now entering the fun to make money on the squeeze.      POP... Price goes parabolic. Thursday night many shorts were looking at multi-billion dollar losses that they could not pay. The brokers would have had to pay those. So the brokers all decide to stop letting GME be bought. The shorters go to work Friday and sell, sell, sell... They drive the price down to $200 while opening new shorts at $450. Now a lot of shorts are in the green, but they haven't necessarily closed.   &#x200B;  Over the course of the next week people become despondent, fearful, and many sell. This gives shorts that opened at $450 downwards lots of liquidity to close shorts if they want, banking a killing. Those original shorts under $40 MAY have been closed as they were to average out with their other plays that worked. All in all most shorts are now hedged with long and short plays so nothing in particular can kill them. They are no longer cornered.      Since then the price has went UP and DOWN a lot. Every time it goes up it's a new opportunity for new short positions and new long positions. Every time it goes down it's an opportunity for shorts to close and bank profit and new longs to go in. The positions of every player now mean no one is overly compromised or stuck, there are just a lot of players involved with different profit targets. This means we shouldn't see any big margin calls or any forced covering of shares. These guys can wait it out, or they are hedging with their long calls if the price goes crazy stupid up. They are not idiots despite getting in this situation.      So while the GME price might be volatile and it might even get back to $500 the underlying infinite squeeze is no longer possible.      The only real way that the average retail guy can make money now is by being smart with your price entry and your price exit. Have a price target. Do you want to make 10%, 20%, 50%? Have that in mind and start taking profits once you are ahead. All that capital you will make you can use on your next trade.      Good luck to everyone, but do not buy into this situation as the conditions being the same as before- they are SO different... I don't know why this level of delusion pisses me off so much. Stop turning this sub into a conspiracy group. Hedge funds are not fucked and every point you've made can be debunked with 5 minutes of basic research and rational thought. Goddamn you GME tards are insufferable I’m having trouble believing that Melvin/Gabe lied to Congress about being out of their GME shorts. Are there different players now? I’m still watching the Interactive Brokers fee to borrow shares for my cue on when to jump back in, and it’s at 9%. That’s not insignificant, but I want that above 20. Source: iborrowdesk. So is GME to $500 happening this year no matter what? On/for the second run, I was at 48 but now I'm at 109.yes I averaged up and I don't think yours is high  GME has been good to me since the first run so I love GME Wasnt there some article estimating 9% of americans hold GME? at 1 share each thats 29million shares, then add in the folks that have 20, 50, 100, 1000. Now add in the folks around the world holding.      This leads me to believe holding will move the market, at least in the way of forcing someone's hand. I also think it means that if enough of us sell a few to recoup investments, we could seriously stunt the climb. GME could do a share offering for 200M shares at $100. Then shorts could cover. But that would mean gamestop bailing out the predatory shorts who were trying to destroy their company. And $100 is not that high of a valuation. I think they could pick a higher price like 1k or 2k per share. That would set a ceiling on the squeeze max price and wouldn't go to infinity. If he admitted in that hearing that they didn't cover or only partially covered, GME would have skyrocketed right then and there and it would never come back down anywhere near $50-$100 again. There is no way he'd admit to still being short, it would absolutely ruin them. At least with us not knowing for sure, they have time to form a plan to recoup some of their losses. Because the amount of money some of the shorts would lose would spill over into the rest of the market.  It's no coincidence that everytime gme is green, the rest of the market is red.  I personally think that some of the shorts liquidate their positions in other huge holdings to buy them time and hold off the inevitable when GME is green For point #1 I've already posted comments on my thoughts on the recent spike and accurately predicted what would happen.  For point #2 and #3 the 33 million short volume is a non event. These could've been hedged or they could've been closed out already. A very small fraction of these will actually contribute to short interest and to definitively say this means another 66% short interest was added to GameStop is fucking ludicrous.  Also, the obligatory complaining about Cramer and short ladder attacks in every GME post nowadays. Newsflash: there's know way of knowing Cramer's agenda and every time the price goes down it doesn't mean there's a short ladder attack. It usually means that people less retarded than the ones making these posts are securing profits.  It's much more prudent to invest on actual market data and company fundamentals rather than investing off of stories. I can see why the story of the little retail investor versus the evil hedge funds and corrupt media is appealing but when all the evidence is just conspiracies that can't be proved then you're not investing, you're gambling. And it's not the fun type of gambling that this place used to be about, it's really just sad 33 is a sign. 26 letters in the alphabet.  33 - 26 is 7.  7th letter is G 3/3 =1, 1&3 is 13.  13th letter is M 3 turned around is an E  GME confirmed.  What price?  3rd letter is C, Roman numeral for 100 100x100 (CxC) is $10,000  This is not financial advice. I am a pomeranian. Holy shit this is dumb lol, go look at the market cap of GME and compare it to the market cap of any major market index. It’s orders of magnitudes away, not even comparable Well for one at 100k GME would be worth almost 20% of the entire worlds economy. You really think that's going to happen? Really? Even one iota of a chance? That would be a perfect line of questioning.  ""Mr. Plotkin is there a difference between closing a short position and covering a short position?""  ""Please explain""  ""so when you said you closed your position under oath you meant also that you covered it correct?""  ""Have you opened any short positions in etfs with GME holdings at any time since the last hearing?""  ""Have you opened any long puts or short call contracts on GME since the last hearin"" Me too! And I just started on Feb 18th. Did great for 2 days. Then last week for pummelled! My head is bloodied but unbowed. I will HOLD till my GMEs are $100K it’s the only way to make up for 2008 destroying my Dad!!! It’s bloody bloody war!! 👩‍🦳🦍💎🦍💎❤️ My GME was down $50k but is now up$30K. Thanks, Melvin, Gabe, Vlad and Kenneth!!!! Feels mandatory that you buy 5 more shares of GME to have a total of 1337. For the luck & all. How can people invest 100'000$ in GME? Be a smart trader. Take the gains out of GME and invest in your next few ideas. Keep putting that cash to work and get to the tendie heaven faster than all of these diamond dicks. 🚀💩 There were some 17 year olds who put like more than 3k into GME. Na you right. I also had positions in FUTU at the time that netted a lot. YTD I brought my account from $20k to $86k. So no, GME wasn’t all of it but a good portion for sure GME crew: We got no food, no jobs, our pets heads are falling off, but the moon is near. Got some more shares of GME. Traded the van for them straight up.  You know, Lloyd, just when I think you couldn't possibly be any dumber you go and do something like this AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF! I’m about ready to sell my dead bird to a blind kid, and buy more GME! My Apt complex thinks we have raccoon 🦝 problem but little do they know it’s this $GME Bull rummaging to survive because I’m not selling. I’m not fucking selling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And we haven’t landed yet. I’d say that scene is more representative of the GME haters who think spike #1 was the squeeze. Would you be interested in trading some GME for screen legend Anthony Quinn's t-shirt? My wife’s boyfriend has a six figure income and I play GME for fun. You people need to relax. It’s a meme. I’m really sick of the GME shit lmao You must be retarded. Do you know how many calls closed in the money on Friday? Are you aware of how many shares need to be covered before Wednesday between AMC and GME. It is mindboggling. They are going to have to pull some funky ass shit to prevent either from running up this week. You sold your dead bird to a blind kid to buy GME?? Each round just increases the probability for future spikes in buying volume of shares for call/put spreads. Combine that with a large percentage of held outstanding and shorting. Especially, with retail being a factor in GME and AMC. They can only limit the upticks with hedging. No one has been accurately predicting when one would exactly occur. Just gotta hold and see. Okay. But there seems to be options out there that represent 1/3 of all GME shares, and this is just when looking at options with strike price 200 USD and under. Surely market makers do not own that much right now, but will need to go shopping if it looks like they close in the money.  There is a possibility that options could drive share price up but it depends on who has them and do they have the funds and interested to actually buy the underlying stocks also. This is accurate. If some apes, hypothetically, wanted to cause such a hypothetical squeeze, the smallest price for the highest delta would be most effective.   Corollary: trying to squeeze GME again is a waste of money due to implied volatility driving up the cost of contracts; significantly more leverage could be attained on other popular tickers like AMC or RKT.  If it was combined with a particularly high short interest on a ticker, fun times could happen. Not saying anyone ought to do this. It's all hypothetical autism and not investment advice. OP I've commented a few times in this thread already, but I just want to say thanks for posting this. This post contains some of the best discussion I've seen in this sub for the past month. I'm still faithful for GME mooning again, but I'm tempering my expectations this time around.  &#x200B;  I honestly still don't understand why GME mooned this past week, but I'll take it for premium increases on options lol. I wasn't expecting much price action until late March (earnings). So what’s the GME high going to be in March?! If you think they are 1:1 hedging on GME you are mistaken My exact thoughts. The reason for the gamma squeeze in January when GME hit 72 and closed around 60 was because the MMs were not expecting it - those were actually naked calls and caused the price to hit 150 pretty early on the next Monday. This time they were ready for this because they know how volatile the situation is so I wouldn't expect GME to balloon next Monday/Tuesday. [GME - Uncle Bruce Explains](https: youtu.be/VwXLRoAw3Z4)  Uncle Bruce on YouTube explains a strategy for a Hedgie to go from short, shift their position, and become long at the same time. This may trigger the squeeze... hopefully.  Anyhoo... How plausible is this? I saw moving pictures while I ate my crayons, and this old ape seems to know lots of big words. I'm still very new to this, so putting this out there for your autists and retards to consider.   I wish I could buy more GME, but have no more cash. Especially after my Millenial ape son told me I should invest even more!   GME - 21.71 units @ 130.46  I like the stock.  (Note: I think my account may be to new to post (according to guidelines), so just leaving this link here.) No, a lot of call writers are naked calls.   This is totally fine, normally, where there is lots of liquidity and the stock behaves within expected reason- this is how the option is priced aftercall.    GME can possibly make a new problem for the options writers who do have to locate a fair bit of stock on Monday/Tuesday... We already know the float is very small. If anything happens that's the day I think. Thanks for the link, very interesting information. 👍  Let's say 3k% ownership of mutual funds is not really correct and does not represent the real picture due to the way it is calculated, but over 100% of institutional ownership, WTF???  What would happen if GME board recalled the shares? And if institutions own 112% of GME, what does that leave for retail?    Could it mean that we (retail) bought shares that never actually existed, sort of ""virtual shares""? Its not nice in nyc. Cloudy and cold lol. I also have no positions in AMC or GME. I don’t care to trade it. You do understand that even if someone sold naked calls they can and do roll them to the next week and up a strike price or two for a credit.  I do it all the time.  I had some GME (they are covered calls) $60C from this past Friday I rolled out a week and up to $68C for a small Credit to me.  House tends to win. When I roll them out the OI on those calls decreases because me as the writer am effectively taking those calls out of the pool by writing new ones for the next Friday. “Dynamic delta hedging” means the market makers hedged all of this week right into the close and are basically 100% hedged as of 4:15 PM. That’s how it works. Market makers don’t sell calls then wait until Friday at 4 to figure out they’re short $30M of GME THEN say “oh well that sucks I could buy in the aftermarket but nah I’ll wait until Monday. My boss will love this.” Eh it wasn't inconsequential on 1/25, and it was consequential enough that the IBKR chairman halted buying on IBKR for that reason alone (they definitely don't have liquidity issues). That being said, it won't be the driver people here are expecting it to be. The price on 1/25 fell just as fast as it climbed. It won't be enough buying pressure to produce a sustained price increase. But it might be enough buying pressure to make people think something is happening so they buy a bunch of calls, then rinse and repeat late January.  Edit: don't downvote OP here. His reply to me is generally correct. GME is an exception because there have been a lot of retarded call sellers. You know people who trade GME and AMC are not normal traders, may not think things logically. If you are neutral then stop saying to people here there is no big day next week for GME and AMC, you don’t know that;) I don’t trade AMC or GME. IV is way too high for my taste. I just cringe reading all these posts tho. Yeah well he also said the whole system could have crashed if they didn’t stop buying because there were options for “150M shares” bought and only 50M shares out.  1) I checked. OI on 1/27 and 1/28 totaled 150k and 100K (10M and 15M shares) respectively. Which is a sht ton on a stock with 50M float but it’s not 3x the float 2) GME closed Friday 1/29 at $325 meaning a ton of options were ITM. And yet... here we still are. Did GME get massively squeezed the next week? No. Did the financial system crumble? No.  So what he said makes no sense. I get that he’s the founder of IBKR and worth $20B and I’m an idiot on Reddit but the way everyone bought his explanation is wild. Anyone stop to consider he had an interest in over exaggerating the situation to explain why IKBr couldn’t meet collateral requirements? The market is way more dynamic than what you understand.  There is a very small probability that the options you are trading are from 18 months ago.  Many are from a week or two ago.  Even if someone were to sell a LEAP 18 mths out you don't think some of them bought them back when the price bottomed at $38 a couple weeks ago on GME and reduced the OI.  The volume of the underlying stock is driving incrementally more options sales.  These options are new and the OI is constantly going up and down. Wouldn't surprise me if big money was selling a bunch of naked calls on a big spike and then buying them back on a dip for 20 to 25% profit in minutes or hours.  I sold a bunch of AMC Calls for $17 next Friday when it spiked to over $10.  If I want to I could have already bought them back for 30 to 40% profit and reduce the OI  on my calls.  I am holding because I don't think it will hit and stay above $17 by Friday.  I had some calls I sold last week at $7 that I rolled up to $8 and out a week for a credit. All mine are covered by shares but wouldn't have to be if I had enough capital and options level 4. Lol add GME to it as well. I have no positions in either. No plans on it as well. Go jerk off to that. If GME reaches $9969 by the end of 2021 I will get tattoo of first emoji poasted in comment to me This is really good, but imagine the GME video editing budget when we get to the moon, we’ll put Lucasfilms and marvel to shame. 🙌💎🚀🌙 You have $1000 extra $$$ to buy GME on Monday, what would you do my fellow apes.... sitting at 216 shares at a average of $79.... was thinking what else I can add to the moon fund 😂 Damn that was a movie premier for GME Well done video let’s go GME 🚀🚀🚀🌝 💎🚀 going to Uranus BUY GME!

Planet GME (i made this when we couldn't post videos but now we can post videos) When the GME movie comes out... instead of previews, AMC theatres should play this and some of the other TOP QUALITY memes that were created here over the past month. This convinced me to buy $900 more worth of GME on Monday. Apes together strong. Lizards with nothing to lose are fast. We can stay retarded longer than the snakes can stay solvent!  🦍🦎💎👏🚀🌞 What a wonderful use of this legendary video clip.  I wonder if David Attenborough also holds a few GME!

I was expecting a ""Planet of the Apes"" trailor Great work man - I was laughing so hard my kid asked me, WTF dad?! Now she's in on GME! On another account one of my top comments was something along the lines of “wtf is going on here?” This was pre GME of course.   Top response: “you’ll fit right in” I literally told that to my coworker during the last GME gamma squeeze. 😂 Can confirm, my GME stock made my dick triple in size too, its now 3 inches long.

I have GME so I’ll put my face in my own tits thank YOU This makes GME sound like a pump and dump scheme you retard 🚀          I'm balls deep (for my cost of living) close to a GME market high (almost the high..315) with a supplemental low purchase to average out my price on stock( 33@ 156), but I also bought options (1 call) to hedge my stock purchase at 10/15 for 120.00. Anyone else buying options on the journey to the moon? Responses appreciated from those who currently hold or have declined to hodl both stock and options but currently hodl at least one or the other after serious DD.

Thousands of insane fuckups tearing apart the Hilton conference room and demanding tendies...**please make this happen!** I get GME is the primary objective here, but don’t forget AMC is on the coming too.

Man, I’m really going to miss all the GME memes from the moon... but wait if all go to the moon, will the party never end! GME will get crushed by Friday next week...back down to sub $50 I like how WSB is just pretending it didn't shit all over GME buyers holders last week, and are back on its dick because there's potential again **I Fucking LIKE GME** Proof or ban.  I doubt it with a 1 month old account that you got in to GME pre-hype. I now want to snort whey protein while stonking up GME The silver game started like 12 years ago.   True holders just don't talk about it.   We just keep stacking quietly with our GME profits ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man) $335 —> $10k. Yes, I sold. I have bills to pay. But I’m still holding shares and will buy more calls on Monday. GME TO ALPHA CENTAURI. 🚀🚀🚀 There’s nothing wrong with this haha! Always make sure you pay yourself at some point! I do recommend getting back in at some point because it’s not over. I anticipate a squeeze this week and a gamma after the stimmies drop. Especially now that cash app allows you to buy GME. These two events may be a bigger catalyst than most anticipate.   Well, my calls and puts are set for April along with DFV. I can’t wait to see what is coming soon!  Just an opinion of course! I never went to college. I haz no financial advize Can someone verify I know what going on? So he bought 100 shares (call option) at $3.35 each. And within 5 days of his purchase GME had to hit at least $57.35 to break even? I went from $900 to $9k on GME too. I lost it all after GME fell from 170 to $100. As usual. Dude that's a call. Absolutely no one should be upset about someone selling a call on GME (much less one that expires next week). Congrats. Haha thanks for the support!  Yep I completely agree, that’s why I plan to buy another call or two on Monday while GME is sitting around $100. Still plenty of room for some more rallies. Been on cashapp waiting for them to put it back, searched it last Thursday and there it was: GME.  what a beautiful sight. I instantly grabbed a share and plan to buy a couple more next week. and im sure a lot more people on CA are going to do the same in the next week as well. Its going to the 🌙, this is not a drill. (I have TD and Fidelity, but haven't moved there for investments yet. Can't trade options on CA.) I am also curious what expiration and strike price you think would be good for GME calls now... the price of most options are getting out of control due to volatility... hard for me to gamble on at this point Watch out for hedge funds ""Bull Trap"".  Hello friends,I just wanted to start by saying that I believe AMC & GME to both be under value at current prices and covid restrictions as well as NYC AMC opening back up.     NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01. The street sentiment is that AMC's price will be rising on Monday because the number of shares needed to brought to covered call options expired ITM. Fundamentally speaking that's how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn't make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF's decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.  Let just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF's ""Bull Trap"" so DO NOT FALL FOR IT & DO NOT SELL your shares, they will be able to use your shares to increase their short interest attacks and continues their ladder attack as well. We need to decrease the number of shares available in the float NOT increase it, by selling your shares you actually increasing it. It is very important to decrease the number of shares available in the float, that's how you trigger the ""Short Squeeze"". Why would the HF's buy shares from us at $100 if they can just buy it from the float at $10 or $15 to cover their short interest? Would you?  Example:  On January 27th AMC shares jumped 300% from $4.97 to $19.90 in one day. What was the reason behind this movement? AMC raising $900 million in the week before or the CEO announcing bankruptcy is off the table? the answer is none of it, it was the classic HF's bull trap, the hf was losing so much money in GameStop they needed to make money somewhere else, they intentionally put money into AMC to raise the price so retail investors would jump in at $14-$19 thinking the price would continue to go up. We all know what happened next, AMC tanked 65% the following day and people who brought AMC in at $14-$19 were trapped, hint the ""bull trap"".  I don't know what will happen on Monday, none of us do, hopefully, AMC price will rise to $10-$11, but do NOT FALL for the Bull Trap if the price rises to $15 or $20 if you sell your shares kiss goodbye to the short squeeze. Why do you think the HF vs retail investors were battling it out over 1 cent on Friday? Literally, it was down to the last minute. Those 120k+ call options were the catalyst that we needed to pressure the hf to buyback 10 of million of shares to cover their short interest.  ""(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.""  The approval of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine couldn't happen at a better time for AMC shareholders. The last time vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized back on November 7th AMC shoots up to 90% and closed over 50% for the day. All the weeds, airlines, hotels, and housing-related stocks were also up 20%-30% as well.  A new vaccine approved and millions of shares buyback, it will be very interesting how this played out on Monday.  Do NOT Sell my friends. 20 more $AMC for market open! 🚀💎🤲🏼🦍 + 2 more $GME for good measure I’m no pro but I don’t believe there’s a bull trap. The stock plummeted because Robinhood (and I believe a few other brokerages) kicked the legs out from under everyone and halted buying on AMC and GME. Only selling. I have question. I have 42 shares of GME. I see alot about AMC om here though, but is this just a distracton? Stop trying to shill amc by using GME.   Shits gross Anything other I can understand but the movement is GME AMC two companies we grew up with that we’re trying to make popular again by shooting up the stock price. Am I correct? Do you actively scrub your comments from your Reddit account? Or is this really your 4th comment ever? Curious  OP also sus having not commented for over a year, prior to jumping into GME and AMC threads to hype up. Things are fucked around here Yeah, AMC has been a distraction from GME this whole time. They really cranked it up these past 2 weeks though It should make you want to hodl more. We are going to bankrupt Wall Street with GME and AMC. Maybe as soon as next week. 8.01 MFs! AMC is the most held stock on the planet and way more affordable to the avg guy/gal. AMC has a much better chance as a long term investment. Overall there is less risk. Almost a guarantee to triple your investment w/o a squeeze. With a squeeze, almost everyone invested could become a millionaire in one trading day. GME may look like a better option short term, or for you, since you probably experienced fomo and yolo’d all your eggs into one basket, but this is an AMC sub, so GTFOH with your “GME is the play bullshit” and go back to your corrupted wsb sub and rot there with your desperate friends. I couldn't afford as much GME. I have 17 shares GME. Oh but youre supposed to hold with GME right? Dude you are fucking retarded. If you wanna be ignorant, I’m just gonna state that GME literally only spiked because of that guy being kicked from the company and its not going back up. I’m new to this WSB too. Like you I bought in T $315 for 15 shares because of the hype. I believe if it wasn’t for the gross manipulation by Robinhood and some other trading platforms this would be way over$500. I have most of my money tied into GME like a true retard. I just bought last week a call on AMC $15. Schwab had a bug on their platform that caused double selling and double buying in client cash accounts. Yes, it is a fucked up disaster. And yes, I'm already talking to lawyers so please none of the ""lawyer up"" shit, I know what I'm doing.  I'm just here to tell you the story.  This bug caused my 401(k) cash account to be out $180k. See my Sunday post last week if you want details: [https: www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a\_bug\_in\_schwab\_caused\_my\_retirement\_account\_to/](https: www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/)  Forget about my account though. Look at the comments. This was me posting randomly on /r/stocks and without prompting for it, I got over 60 comments that said the same thing happened to them.  Let's figure this out with some (admittedly imprecise) napkin math:  * Suppose Schwab is \~5% of total stock market volume. * U.S. Trading volume is maybe $1.250T (between Nasdaq + NYSE) * Suppose the bug affects 5% of trades on Schwab. (This number has to be big enough account for the fact that so many comments appeared on my post) * Suppose each illegal trade on average moves 10% before it gets resolved. * Schwab is on the hook for any of these price movements that result in losses (half the price movements, because half were gains and some customers probably made out like bandits?) * 1250000000000 \* 0.05 \* 0.05 \* 0.1 \* 0.5  **= $156m per day?** in what I'm referring to as ""a giant ball of shit""  Important points:  1. Schwab could be losing something on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per day. Is the bug fixed? I have not seen any announcements about it. It's been over 30 days and I still haven't gotten a clear response from Schwab about my own personal issue. 2. This has been a problem for months, according to the comments. Read through the comments on my post in /r/stocks. 3. Schwab only has about $20B in total equity (according to Wikipedia, 2018) 4. I could have easily left GME naked short in my account. I don't know what Schwab would have done, or how many accounts have gone naked short, and stayed that way...  It still does not appear that the markets have priced this event in, yet. At best, Schwab lost some money. At worst, Schwab is actually bankrupt. I (currently) don't think it's very likely that they're bankrupt, but I do believe the markets are mispricing their stock.  **Schwab: If you don't want us speculating about how big this ball of shit is, then come out and say exactly how big it is. And tell us where the ""fix it"" money is coming from. Not client assets, I hope?**  Stay tuned for some more traditional DD in the coming days/weeks.  [Relevant Positions \(about $50k of puts, doubled down since last post\)](https: preview.redd.it/zaopkdf194k61.png?width=1213&format=png&auto=webp&s=58c53b758434a4dd74514f474367b6e4c8a1e459)  Feel free to read my last Schwab post before I doubled down: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpxqzm/a\_short\_thesis\_on\_the\_charles\_schwab\_corporation/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpxqzm/a_short_thesis_on_the_charles_schwab_corporation/)  TLDR: I hate the stock, I'm buying puts, and Schwab GIVE ME MY FUCKING money back On glitchy Tuesday, 26th I think, Schwab executed my sell to close 10 GME call contracts... twice. I had closed out positions on that account and went to review an hour later only to see I was NAKED short 10 calls of GME as we were squeezing. I had sold for $150 per call but when I saw the account was short the calls had reached $230! I bought to close to mitigate losses and called them.  1) I only have a level 2 option account, I literally can’t naked sell calls  2) you can’t sell to close the same options twice. You would need to sell to close then sell to open.  They eventually refunded the 80k in losses their system caused. TD was glitching bad for me this week. Said my basis for every position was 0.00 and I own a lot of GME too. I’m wondering (conspiracy theorist in me) if we’re genuinely breaking the market and brokerages lol Yo thanks for this.  I'm new to the whole thing, boarded on with GME with some spare pennies back before the sub explosion. I might be getting a new job, and was considering using Schwab for their bank/brokerage account deal they got going on.  Might lean more towards other options like Fidelity now. Schwab also said they didn't prevent people from trading GME the day it exploded past $400. And yet I distinctly remember trying to sell GME at the top and getting an error message. So just to see i try buying at the top same error message. Then when it dropped back to around $112 I tried buying shares same error message. They're involved with this I bought some GME last week. It wasn’t showing up in my account but the order showed as filled.  So you know what I did? Absolutely nothing. And like magic, the shares showed up in my account.   TLDR, stop being a spaz when the volume is nuts. That's what you get for shorting GME. Sucker haha. GME TO THE MOON Shorting GME now is like shorting Tesla the last 2 years or so. Will follow your next $ROPE post Honestly ya. If they didn’t half GME round 1, it would’ve had a big widespread effect. Not recession though. No but in all serious what do you expect buying options on a stock as volatile as GME? What about the IV? Really? Your 401k? Hahahahahahhahahha This kind of nuanced comment is the best part of Reddit. Schwab fucked-up because their system has a bug but OP arguably fucked-up as well in not just letting Schwab fix it which is an easily fixable thing for them.   Software bugs happen in any IT system and is just part of reality. The post is completely valid in complaining about this software bug but seems to be a bit sensationalized by tying it into GME and short-selling when in reality it is just simple double sell that can happen to any stock and is easily remedied by a software fix and by the Broker apologizing and giving some compensation for it. OK - Found the Schwab shill.  You're acting like I should have done something different but you're dead fucking wrong. You act like they respond immediately to phone calls, but that's just not true.  In fact on that day, they simply hung up on me. They aren't around when you need them immediately on busy days.  GME was quicky rising without apparent bound. Take a look at the price on Jan. 27-28. I was watching my cash balance in my account quickly vanish due to this bug.  I didn't know if my account would get margin called. I had no lending agreement. I didn't know if or when Schwab would ever fix this. It could have easily turned into millions of dollars in liability, for SOMEONE, in short order, if GME went up too fast again.  In my fucking RETIREMENT account.  At the time, I knew that if I covered the short, as long as \*that\* worked, I would continue having a 401(k) retirement account with at least some money in it.  You're completely insane if you think anyone should have done anything else. Burry so salty he sold GME early Yea but what you’re not understanding is that they don’t touch the money. Say you wanted to sell your 10 lot GME 150 calls for $1000 and at the same time, I wanted to buy them for $1000 each, I’m not paying you. Our brokerages would match the order and you 10 lot would briefly register at the clearing house before I received my purchase. And then if I were to hold those calls until expiration, the clearing house would be the ones on Saturday morning to expedite calling the contractually obligated shares from the participant that agreed to get called away at $150. This is why I maxed out my credit cards, home equity line, and retirement savings. All to GME. Why? The fear of death. Wanted to use this scene for a while! With the GME reboot it fits nicely! Enjoy!   DIAMOND HANDS! How do I collect my tendies when I sell my GME position at infinity? The big companies say we’re out of our mind. That we don’t know what we’re doing that we’re small tule investors, that we’re going to lose all our money that this will go nowhere.  That GME isn’t something that will take us into retirement or success in the long run. I say FUCK EM! I say it’s time us the “little people” show the “big people” that we can control our own futures, that we indeed know what we’re doing and that we indeed believe in our cause and that we are not going to give in and give them what we want, we don’t care how much money they have or how much power they have, UNITED WE WILL SUCCEED, UNITED WE WILL COME OUT ON TOP, UNITED WE WILL MAKE HISTORY! LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE APES OF THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH ONCE UPON A TIME BOARDED A ROCKETSHIP AND FUCKING BLEW IT INTO MOTHERFUCKING SPACE AND LANDED ON PLUTO AND STUCK A $GME FLAG INTO THE GROUND OF SAID PLANET! Grate ape reporting ,should I sink $100 I just found in the snow into GME ? 100 upvotes and I’ll do it When the GME movie comes out... instead of previews, AMC theatres should just play this and some of the other great memes that were produced on this subreddit. Funny except wallstreet bets had nothing to do with GME going up this week. Trash memes killed this sub Lmao. You fuckers still believe GME is going past 1k???  Get a fucking life already!!! Lol, 😂 😂 😆 The guy just bought GME at $420 with that stack he gave out lmao My buddy Bought GME @ $45 and made $15,000 just on the last runup.  He never sold and is holding this long term Diamond hands.  He is holding this for his kids. Hitler shorts GME https: m.youtube.com/watch?v=R8JX005MZeE Its accurate cuz GME holder didnt get any of that cash Hodling on to my GME stonk Holding GME = interest rate 100% memes  I like audio too though di- did he just use the stolen money to buy GME? lmao My nips get hard too, when I think about buying more GME. My nips get hard like that when I buy GME too Damn you GME retards are like some sort've Super Mutated type Autist you funny Holy shit I’m so inspired to buy more GME monday Soooo against all logic you want me to buy a shit load of GME on Monday morning?! I hate you retards so much....but I like your memes....I’m fucking in! There will be time when a good meme will spike the price of GME Should I buy GME currently? Or bide my time Yeah, my nips also get hard when I buy GME This applies more to AMC than GME, the Chad should add like 5x his money to the sum he took from the robbers lol Why is he buying GME from GameStop? 😂 GME to $250 There’s never been a better time to buy $GME call options. We are on the brink of possibly reaching Mars ! The cash he took out of Citadel's pocket should have been labeled $GME 1/28 420C This Video tickles both sides of my brain. Both Monkey and Retard side light up like a Christmas tree. Monkey cant read but likes violence, retard likes to buy GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀 GME to $1,000🚀 Haha that fucking SLV. Then goes back to get more GME. True art! AMC TO THE MOON FORGET GME Move to XSPA. This stock is trying to help the world and being shorted more the GME! COme on people! ￼≡  Redditors, Ryan Cohen Needs Your Help to Send GME Stock Back to $500  2/26/2021 1:32pm EST  By Thomas Yeung, CFA, InvestorPlace Markets Analyst  In 2015, the Financial Times joked that RadioShack, an ailing brick-and-mortar electronics chain, should consider selling fruit baskets or turning its stores into Zumba studios to survive. The retailer had ignored the threat of e-commerce for so long that few believed it could survive. Two years later, RadioShack was virtually no more.  ￼￼  Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com  Today, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock sits at a similar juncture. Since the early 2010s, GME’s top brass had treated the retailer like drunks at an open bar — doling out a princely dividend to shareholders (and stock options to themselves) while cutting reinvestment into aging stores. But then something happened: A group of retail investors, driven by Reddit’s hedge-fund-hatin’ r/WallStreetBets decided to take GME stock from $10 to $480 in a matter of weeks. The people still love GameStop! This love for GameStop and disdain for Wall Street is an unusual combo. It means that, unlike RadioShack in 2015, the video game retailer still has a fighting chance. For the good of GameStop and its shareholders, Reddit investors need to finish the revolution they started. And if they do, Redditors and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) founder Ryan Cohen can still send GME stock back to $500.  GME Stock: Intentionally Driven into a Ditch  Anyone who’s recently visited a GameStop store will tell you the same thing: They look old. And that’s by design. For over a decade, GameStop’s management has enriched shareholders at the expense of the firm. GameStop’s capital expenditure, the budget used to maintain its stores, peaked in 2011 at almost $200 million before getting cut in favor of larger dividends and share buybacks. Meanwhile, the company’s stores have continued to age, and layoffs have continued unabated. Yet, shareholders allowed then-CEO J. Paul Raines to maintain the course. Why? It made them money. Customers, employees and other stakeholders weren’t a priority. And after several failed acquisitions, including game developer Kongregate, GameStop’s management decided that milking the company for cash was a better bet. The firm’s blind commitment to mediocrity reached a peak at the April 2020 strategy meeting. There, GameStop management outlined a plan to “optimize the core” and “become the social / cultural hub for gaming” through building “experiential labs.” In other words, they wanted to drive more in-store traffic. During a pandemic year. (How on earth did management earn $35 million between them?)  Change Afoot? Redditors Think So.  All that began to change in August 2020, when Chewy founder Ryan Cohen bought 9 million shares of the retailer. He and two associates would later join the board in January 2021. “GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences — not remain a video game retailer that over-prioritizes its physical presence and stumbles on the online ecosystem,” said Mr. Cohen in a public letter to the board. Investors were delighted, sending shares on an initial run from $4 to $40. Mr. Cohen wasn’t just talking about improving e-commerce (a strategy that might have worked 15 years ago). Instead, he spoke of fundamental changes to GameStop’s business that could create a new, revitalized player in the $180 billion gaming industry. Change, however, won’t come readily. And that’s where Reddit investors come in. To date, Mr. Cohen only owns 13% of the company. That’s not enough to dislodge GameStop’s existing board; as late as last year, the board fought off another activist investor with grand plans for change. To be clear, there’s nothing particularly nefarious about current CEO George Sherman or his team. (Redditors, please don’t send pizzas to his house at 1 a.m.) Managing a declining business is already hard during good times and nearly impossible during crises. But to become an agent of change, Mr. Cohen needs more than his vote in the video game retailer. He needs other investor support.  Reddit Investors, Unite!  To date, Reddit investors have driven up GME stock using a financial quirk known as delta-gamma hedging. It happens when many investors buy deeply out-of-the-money calls — the lottery tickets favored by the r/WallStreetBets crowd. And in one of Wall Street’s least-understood processes, as prices rise, market makers will buy more GME stock to hedge their positions. That creates a feedback loop that pushes prices even higher. But for GameStop to reach a $500 price (and stay there), Redditors will need more than Wall Street’s quirks. To do more, they will need the four tools of activist investors: invest, strategize, agitate and vote.  Activist Investing 101  There’s the obvious first step with activist investing: Investors need to buy GameStop shares and hold on. Options can make you fabulously wealthy, but only common stockholders can vote in shareholder meetings. Next, investors need to strategize what’s best for GameStop. Sucking the lifeblood out of a dying company can make shareholders some money, but it won’t turn GME into a $35 billion firm. Neither will trying to beat established players like Twitch or Valve at their own game. Instead, winning strategies will involve identifying technologies a decade out and investing before others do. (A virtual reality universe, anyone?) Third, shareholders need to make their voices heard — something Redditors seem pretty good at doing already. With a single well-crafted public letter to the board (plus some backroom dealing), Mr. Cohen managed to gain three board seats. Smaller investors might not have the same platform, but they can undoubtedly start pressuring GME’s board to move faster. And finally, shareholders need to vote. Most investors typically outsource voting to their brokerages, making annual meetings a rubber-stamp ordeal. But unless shareholders come to Mr. Cohen’s aid, change won’t come fast enough.  Time Is Running Out for GME Stock  Reddit and Mr. Cohen will have to work fast. Thanks to their years of corporate debt binging, GameStop now sports a 3.5x debt-equity ratio. The retailer spends over $300 million in interest, upkeep and leasing costs, which will burn through its $446 million cash hoard faster than most people expect. Mr. Cohen has presumably seen the writing on the wall. Without drastic changes, GameStop’s chances will melt away faster than the ice cream cone that Mr. Cohen mysteriously posted on Twitter this week. That’s what makes CFO Jim Bell’s resignation on Wednesday so remarkable. Clearing the caretaker ranks is an essential first step to a turnaround, and Mr. Cohen seems to have pulled the board out of its slump. But more still has to happen. And Mr. Cohen needs your help, Reddit. For GameStop to reach $500, the firm would need a $35 billion market capitalization, or more than the value of Twitch and Steam combined. A secondary offering at $150 per share would be a start. A roughly 10% dilution would raise $1 billion, something AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) did during its January stock run-up. But money alone won’t solve GameStop’s decline. The firm desperately needs a new vision among its management ranks. Re-hiring a COO would be a good first step — the firm hasn’t bothered with one since 2019. Charting a long-term strategy (and finding the right person for the job) would be even better. In short, GameStop needs a strategy shift that should make even Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) co-founder Reed Hastings nod in approval. Mr. Cohen has worked his magic on Chewy.com before. And maybe he’s even the right person to take the top job at GameStop. But before he can start down that route, the 35-year-old founder will need all the help he can get. And with a Reddit-fueled megaphone, retail investors finally have the chance to make that happen. Good luck, Redditors. I’ll see you guys on the moon.

And the part where WSB absolutely shit on everyone who bought and hold when it dropped to the 40s and are back to sucking GME off again now that it's seeing traction one more time.   🥴 I still cannot believe that they thought that we are so naive to distract us with “something shiny” haha. Unbelievable! Like imagine the thought process in their headQ: “cmon quick think of something to distract them from buying more GME, yuum let’s SILVER!! We tell them that silver is squeezing” Fuckin manipulative retards! So I have recently been doing a lot of research on recessions, and it’s hard to deny that it looks like we might be sitting on the brink of one. I recently watched a video by Jake Tran regarding the striking similarities between the Great Depression and today. Rock bottom interest rates on the rise, the average debt of individual Americans, the number of retail investors involved in the market (which also correlates with Germany’s hyper inflation in the WW1-2 era as suggested by Michael Burry), and the fact that wealth inequality is at an all time high since the days right before the Great Depression. It seems to me at least that we are looming over some treacherous waters.  How does that correlate with GME?   Well, as we have seen, anytime there is an increase in GME there is a corresponding decrease in the rest of the market. Whether that be from hedge funds liquidating other stock to fight the GME war or the general fear of investors of the implications that come with GME. It has now happened both with the January and February rises and is not a coincidence. The markets fell by as much as 3% in a single day when GME was on the rise.   Now, there has been some talk of a gamma squeeze still in the making. I’m not sure about it, but some Redditors are putting the date as March 19th, or at least in the weeks surrounding March 19th. How accurate is that? IDK you apes can go find the DD yourself, but it certainly seems a distinct possibility. If it does occur though, and it squeezes into the thousands or even tens of thousands, the resulting impact on the market will be tremendous. And given the delicate situation the market is in, could very well trigger a recession.   Now what I find interesting is what happens in a recession, theoretically pinpointed on March 19th. Whenever a countries economy gets slapped around it affects the global economy, and a crash on this scale would certainly cause global issues. Historically, whenever there has been recessions, war always breaks out. Almost every time. Not necessarily in the US, but across the other nations as well. Considering our recent forays into the Middle East again, I don’t see us not getting dragged in. I also believe the tense situations over in that China, India, Pakistan area is a powder keg ready to let loose as well (remember all those Tik Toks with the Pakistani kids vowing to destroy India? They hate each other).   So at this point, given where we stand, I almost think it’s more risky to not have a share of GME as a hedge against market collapse. And if it all goes south and GME goes to Pluto, I’m taking the tendies and investing in 3 things:  - the digital security that cannot be named - Precious metals - and most importantly defense stocks  The defense stocks will be at rock bottom prices and I’ll be ready to catch them with my tendies.  Anyway, I’m not a financial advisor, I hardly know what I’m talking about in this discussion. I’m just and ape with a box of Crayolas. If you have a wrinkly brain feel free to tell me where I went wrong.   TLDR: It’s too risky to not own GME. Taking the tendies upon market collapse and buying defense stonks. The year was 2021, GME causes mass turmoil and brings on armageddon. Thanks Obama. It does seem like a perfect storm is brewing, markets have been due for a correction for some time now.  Too risky to not be in GME, I like that, and I like the stock My retarded mind only read the last line, MORE GME$ With all the IV GME has it's fucked up to think that it is actually the safe play right now if you believe in a market collapse but the correlations (0.40-0.5 range and statistically significant too) that people have gotten don't really lie. What a time to be autistic I buy speculative options frequently...they pay off sometimes and sometimes they don't...$DPZ killed me this week. If I can throw $1K at a pizza company I can throw $2K at $GME options while I still hold shares...  No brainer...I see $GME as a chance to get a windfall in your hands while the market shits the bed. Transfer those gains into depressed sell offs.. 2x up did you say buy GME?  OK I;m holding and buying more tomorrow.  Lets push this to $200.... YO, THIS IS NOT A BIG SECRET.  THE STOCK HAS A BETA OF -2.3.    replace all that text with this:  GME beta =     -2.3 In other words,  owning GME is like owning toilet paper when the  pandemic comes? “it’s more risky to not have a share of GME as a hedge against market collapse.”  No. Equities de-risk in a market collapse — GME will not inflate further. GME has a Beta of 1.95, meaning it’s nearly two times as volatile as the overall market. It’s not an inverse correlation, it’s 2X as correlated.    No one knows what will trigger the next collapse. On average a 10% market decline happens 2.5 times per year. Will this be a depression, recession, or simply a correction. No one knows. But returns on capital are 2X the rate of return on economic output. They stimulus is fueling economic output — capital will follow suit. But meme stocks like GME and AMC haven’t yet proven how they will reinvent themselves for high Returns on Capital. No doubt, there’s a thesis for GME — like Ryan Cohen’s idea to turn GME into a digital gaming powerhouse — but this will take time to play out. But it’s more likely that market downturns will happen between now and then, and GME will decline more than market in such a scenario.  If you believe in it’s transformation, there may be buying opportunities. But stocks don’t cuddle. GME as a tendie will fade, just as all tendies do. If you want to protect yourself in a market correction, look to well capitalized companies with strong cash flow. Even better, companies that are delevering, reducing debt, buying back shares. Berkshire Hathaway BRK-B, BMY, GILD all have Betas less than 1. These are the types of stocks to own if you believe zombie stocks (with higher debt interest than earnings) will get crushed soon. Example of zombie stocks are Macy’s and Exxon.  Best of luck. You lost me at I've recently been doing a lot of research. So congratulations, or better luck next time, and of course we like the stock. More GME, more bananas. I love 🍌🍌🍌. Very interesting post, it makes sense to me that a pending crash could be set off by GME. What defence stocks are you thinking? To buy GME first I need amc to hit at least 150😅 Listen I’m on the GME train but I think most of you have severe unrealistic expectations as far as an endgame price. It was $500, $800, 10k, 100k even a retard knows that’s not happening. You think the financial world and leaders are going to let GME collapse the system?? Nope. So try and be somewhat smart here. Whip out your $GME shares for Harambe. GME has a negative beta though, if you look at the past 5 years, which kinda flips things around. Respect your side, but I’m gonna have to disagree, there’s more factors at play here than traditional investing imo The Legend of GME. Lol in all honesty can we stop painting roaring kitty as the GME catalyst?  Cohen dropped $75 MILL into the company.  Lol What is the max sell point for GME ? 500 1,000 20,000? Realistic price for sale? GME apekind GME GME GME Sell and buy GME wtf. Be in for the cause and be in for the real tendies! Yes AMC to the core.. I have as many putts on the stock as I could buy. It’s gonna tank like the titanic did. I don’t know why you guys would even think it will ever be a GME.. it’s a 2.50 stock and that’s it’s... it belongs on a pink sheet otc HFs are pushing AMC to get traders distracted from GME. It’s been happening since the first squeeze. Just look at how their trends match exactly. Little do most people know, AMC is not a gamma squeeze like GME. Yes we know. You got into GME and now you hate AMC as is the new retard trend. We get it. It’s not a GME, you simpleton. Why do you guys assume every stock is about shorting? How many GME do you hold @300+?  Be honest. Wow you got HUGELY brigaded   It is absolutely on the money as well.  Guys, do the basic level of DD on each business and compare them.  GME is totally different from AMC. Just because ignorant points of view make them LOOK the same, they are seriously **seriously** not the same. Hedge funds made more money on GME than in the whole last year. They are playing both sides and winning at both sides. Do you think they didn't make money from buying it cheap and selling it high? Do you think they didn't make money from trading options? There is only one hedge fund that got busted, the one that sold it very cheap. For the rest it's a gold mine. Yep 33 days and the truth hurts. I’m all for making a quick dollar but a lot of you guys miss lead young people into losing the life savings to make a dollar for your self. (Wolf of Wall Street) I have lost a dime in the whole GME/AMC/SNDL thing that has happened but I’ve heard about and it’s sad. For starters game stop as a business is crap. All the kids that probably lost there money in the market are the same kids that got ripped by the stores. They ones who have made out are the CEO and other officers that had free stock given to them... not you guys. And all you did was make a group of shit head CEO’s richer..if they wanted to fix the company they would have rolled there gains into making it a better company and not calling it quits. Mind you I have lost a dime... never bought a single share. So I have nothing invested in it. I have putts that AMC drops but that’s the inevitable. Netflix and HBO max are gonna put them out of business anyways. Nobody goes to the theater anymore pre COVID they didn’t either, unless it was Star Wars movies. All of you know I’m right. I’m glad some of you have gain a lot but remember that when you win someone else will lose and some day you will be on the losing end. That’s the thing, I’ve been brigaded every time I’ve brought this up. GME and AMC are different and people keep lumping them together. I’ve never said AMC is not a good investment it’s just not a gamma short squeeze. Just trying to help the retards. WILL YOU JOIN IN OUR CRUSADE  WHO WILL BE STRONG AND HOLD WITH ME  BEYOND $1000  IS THERE A YACHT YOU LONG TO SEE  THEN JOIN IN THE FIGHT  AND GO BUY SOME MORE GME WILL YOU HODL ALL YOU CAN HODL   SO THAT GME MAY BALLOON?   SOME WILL SELL AND SOME WILL BUY   WILL YOUR DIAMOND HANDS START TO PRUNE?  THE SQUEEZE OF THE HEDGIES   WILL ROCKET US TO THE MOON! BUY as much GME as you can rationally afford on Monday, you will recover. can you get in on $GME ? Such cringe, much retardation  u/zjz, how is this karma-farming bullshit allowed? The dude is clearly looking for clout and trying to gain internet points. A margin call isn’t a loss and the boomer dumbass and his possible sugar baby are posting this here for what? [because they think they’re just as victimized](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltuu37/3m_lossgot_a_call_yesterday_to_say_that_a_margin/gp24gjx) as the GME and AMC holders when Robinhood restricted trading. Not the same. It’s not news that brokerages can raise the margin rates on a whim, even crayon-eating retards here know that. This IRL retard wrote a $3M check easily after posting this cringe. Fucking clowns, go play the victim somewhere else. Wait wait wait,  so this smooth brain mfr wrote a 3mil check to cover a loss on a loan,  BUT DUMB ASS COULDN'T DROP 3MIL INTO GME STOCK AND HELP IGNITE THE THRUSTERS ON THIS ROCKET??!!??  Tldr: you sir, are truly retarded That’s what happens when you Short GME and AMC. Make it all back with GME. Finally a proper WSB post in the sea of cringy GME gayness. Shoulda put it all in GME at the $40 dip, fool Just to be clear, this guy is a GME shorter? Shouldve bought GME Ali doesn't trade GME at all, and hasn't. He trades in FUBO, BIDU, PRTS, BB, SRNE, CLVS, GMBL, MLLLF, ZUO, WWE, MGNI, PUBM, IRDM, OSTK, RNWK,MSTR,TSLA, VYGVF, PAR, FUTU, FUBO, LODE, PBI, and AI. Those are his longs. Ali has two shorts: FB and W Ali doesn't trade GME at all, and hasn't. He trades in FUBO, BIDU, PRTS, BB, SRNE, CLVS, GMBL, MLLLF, ZUO, WWE, MGNI, PUBM, IRDM, OSTK, RNWK,MSTR,TSLA, VYGVF, PAR, FUTU, FUBO, LODE, PBI, and AI. Those are his longs. Ali has two shorts: FB and W Is Fidelity a market maker on the hook for buying GME and AMC stocks on Monday? Are they maybe calling in margin because they are absolutely fucked and need the liquidity? Bets on RH IPO short interest beating GME short interest? I don’t use margin and had it on, but I turned it off years ago to make sure I don’t accidentally do something dumb or tempt myself into doing something dumb (like selling uncovered calls on GME like some people have done here) GME go downnnn lol In my humble opinion only, if GME ever holds a shareholder meeting with its shareholders, it will find that us apes own more stock than registered at the exchange in its entirety (about 70M shares registered, and I guesstimate we already own 200M shares, 130M of which are fraudulent) this fraudulent share bag can only be transferred to other bagholders until it is covered. I am just an ape that will hodl, with a propensity to buy more. This is GME! 🚀🚀🚀 Did u/ControlTheNarative actually buy GME? If so that would be absolutely legendary. Next week is going to be one hell of a fight, "" did I say fight "" lol don't break into Wall-street just buy GME retards!! Fuck it, with the stimmy, in placing call options. GME TO THE FUCKING MOON BOYOS Doesn't she support our cause? She seems like she genuinely wants something done about marketmanipulation and what not.  She also made more people aware of the GME situation therefore indirectly making more people buy.  I do agree though that it doesn't fit aswell as some other people do. No. She supports her cause. That's it. She piggy backs to get herself in headlines because she is nothing more than an Instagram thot to leftists and she knows that.   #Here's a recent example:  She joins in Americans anger at Congress for giving a trillion stimulus package that 80% went to Congress' buddies and foreign countries and the other 20% was a measly $600 stfu payment to the people who funded the bill after politicians ruined the country and the economy by shutting the country down.  AOC comes in and acts like *one of us*. Says what we are saying. How bullshit this bill is. How it's over 5k pages and they're only given a few hours to read it before voting. Just how utterly horseshit it all is. Sounds great, right? Yeah AOC! AOC! AOC!!! .....  And then she votes yes for the bill.  She doesn't fight. She doesn't use her *actual power* to help the people or stand up for what is right.  She does what her handlers tell her (which you have to remember is THE ENTIRE PUPROSE OF HER and how she got into office. She was literally a casting call from the DNC to find a minority woman to use as a puppet. Go reread history if you forgot how she was even brought into politics). She has not, nor ever will fight for the people. She will do what her handlers tell her so long as she gets to stay rich and in congress, just like McConnell and Pelosi.   She will make all the tweets in the world to get her exposure, then vote against us every time. Look at her voting record. You cannot argue against this.   This is arguably *worse* than someone who just tells us to fuck off from the start because *at least they're honest* and not betrayers.   Another comparison would be with Maxine. People have been cheering her on *just the same as AOC* simply because they said something about this situation.  And when it comes down to it.. what happens? wants to fuck retail and protect wall street.  Just like they always do.  We would be better off if we had nobody ""rooting for us"" when they're just going to stab us on the back. Dont let a lion into the sheep's herd just because the lion put on a sheep's mask.  If you really believe in AOC then I have a bridge to sell you.   $AMC $BB $GME to the moon 🚀 Short sellers are facing challenges, GME cannot exceed 800, come liquidation me all loser GME - number five greatest stock of all time?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? It makes sense immediately...let me guess your one the people who bought GME at the top. You guys pumped his stock and they took advantage.  He deserves more.  GME should do it has same thing, it would really help them out, I know you're all about helping out these down on their luck corps.  But also it's not the CEO's fault the governments around the country literally banned people from going to the movies.  That's a failure of our government to protect us from threats. Why is it so much hate on AMC??? We are in it because we like the stock GME blew up and most of us saw AMC as an opportunity. Personally I have both but I’m more invested into AMC so to answer your question no this doesn’t piss me off because this is a bullish title. There paying top executives money to stay and turn business around when it was closed for half the year. So now it’s AMC retards vs GME retards?  We may as well introduce politics into this sub. Remember who the enemy is here you hairless shit throwing apes.  I paper handed my AMC and am holding my GME average 19@205.  Short of this scumbag suit we did good things for AMC and should be proud of that.  Too old to be a millennial, too young to be a boomer but being part of this movement was one of the proudest moments I’ve had in a while. STOP FUCKING IT UP.  Remember, we’re all here because we like the stock. amc is the stupidest play IMO - i would get out of that shit while you are ahead and secure more GME.   The one thing that’s driving me to GME is that it’s constantly inconsistent - the data that’s being reported from everywhere for GME varies, no one knows where the shares are, and Everyone knows something is sus there.   For AMC, it’s light weight, and that boomer CEO on CNBC has no idea what to do with this company but wait until a vaccine rollout, i wouldn’t get distracted. At least if you get fucked in GME the long term looks innovative and not the same old stuff lots of corporations have bonuses worked into how a company and its stock does so when it goes up these execs are going to get bonuses so don’t be pissed about that. The good news iis when the stock was high amc used it as a swap to pay down there debt which on the long run makes the company better in the long run.  The fact that management did that means they made a smart move that makes the company more lucrative in the long run and hence helps the stock price go up.  GME did not sell any to pay off their debt which in my eyes was not a smart move by management because they would have been better situated as a company if they did. That’s nothing.  Wait until you see what the CFO at GME is likely to walk away with at the end of March. Over $50M of stock at current value if he gets all shares AND a severance package that has been estimated to be worth over $3.5M per reports.   So potentially $53 million to walk away  Bullshit I say ! Makes me glad I closed my AMC position to buy more GME Don't you guys find this news to come out incredibly perfectly timed ??? Right when we got the hf by their balls and we're awaiting for Monday.... Right when they are in a bad position, negative news pops up about the company they shorted.... Hmmm... And I say negative news because the general population... That includes 🐵🐒 .. perceive big fat bonussen to ceos especially during bad times to be negative.  I find the timing too perfect for this news to affect peoples opinion about the company and start selling their stock...  I'm keeping and buying the dip, similar to GME. I'm in it for the ride to the moon.  I'm am ape and this is not financial advice. I only know my bananas. Fuck AMC... let them burn!!!!!   GME to the Moon Boyz!! Just for this I might cash out on amc and put it in GME SELL AMC ( now he's  a black sheep of the SQUEEZE family )   BUY GME!!! Ignore amc already man, fully concentrate on GME 🙌💎 turn on AMC- GO TO GME💎👐🏽🚀🐸🍦 So why do people give a shit about squeezing AMC? I think y’all should just go back to GME and pop that shit like a puss filled pimple!!   Note: Divide and conquer doesn’t always work in the financial industry. Hence the reason why this hasn’t succeeded yet. If y’all stop using ur little tard brains and focus on the main squeeze to squoze then this shit might get squoshed. No pass on the vibe check. GME only now Why are all you retards dividing the amc and gme play, they have been side by side since day one. When GME is running AMC is running. The charts have been identical for 2 months now. TIME TO UNLOAD AMC AND REFILL GME LADS! Don’t forget the objectives here bring down HF. Just love both AMC and GME. This is sounds suspicious great timing when we’re about to Gamma squeeze AMC People are surprised? GME has always been the right play. Power to the Players. You apes better sell you AMC shares and get some GME while you still can Stick with GME! Well let’s see bonus does not effect any shareholders. We are the buying power. AMC is the most held stock on the planet. It definitely has been shorted into the ground. Almost to the point of bankruptcy for the past 15 months. Hfs we’re betting on it. Then the turn around came. Shares after shares being bought. Look at Friday alone. 8.01 magic number? 🤷‍♂️ we are hoping so. This bus may take a little while to get where GME is at now. But this bus will be there and when it is GME will be holding on to the coattails of the his rocket. Amount of shares are dwindling down to 0 fast. Did you witness the last 3 minutes on Friday to see the seriousness of AMC holders? Thank god I didn’t put any money in AMC. GME was the play the whole time and is lined up to be the MOASS🚀🚀 Atleast we know Ryan Cohen and company have us in mind Bitch ass old man can't even get a jacket that fits his literal retarded ass. And I bought GME @ 300 Glad I sold all my AMC to fund my GME 💎✋🚀 AMC was always a shit company on the brink of death. They can blame covid, but these fucks were only still floating due to what was basically a monopoly of their niche.  I hate the company, but I like the stonk.   You could say the same about GME and their shitty business practices. The difference is GME has a new massive bankroll investor willing to drag them out of the stone age.   ..and to the moon! Sold that before GME spiked, to buy more GME. That was good move CEO pay & bonuses are usually tied to stock prices, so if $GME hits high targets the man gets paid regardless of if he had any say in how the stock went up. That’s Wall Street. Sell your AMC and buy GME.   &#x200B;  I am not an advisor, I am a retard with bigger testicles than brains GME would treat you better. Lets goooo. 100k minimum. Honestly, I always wondered if AMC themselves saw what GME was going through and just low key pushed the same squeeze narrative. That's why AMC can never do a GME, cuz they don't have the secret Cohen sauce. If I was invested in AMC, I would abandon ship and joined the GME rocket. But I won’t tell you what to do. What an absolute bag of shit.  GME gang would like to invite you all to come play at our house anytime. I put all my GME money into AMC. Did I make a mistake? Well if you're upset then you shouldn't have any stock in AMC.  Stop supporting a restaurant that gives bad service and food like some idiot.   Come over to GME. 🚨🚨Retard Thinking Out Loud🚨🚨  I’ve been wondering if it’s foreshadowing potentially good news for AMC’s earnings report. If the earnings report is positive, then maybe the bonuses are “deserved” for saving the company through the pandemic. I’m also curious whether these bonuses are higher or lower than AMC’s prior bonuses.   However, if the company is down overall and still likely failing, then it’s concerning about AMC’s priorities and could hurt the 1,000s of new investors (gamblers) here!  But with that said, is anyone here really buying $AMC or $GME because of the company’s fundamentals. We’re mostly here because some people much smarter than us realized how over shorted both stocks were and the potential for rocket growth if the shorts had to start buying to cover their positions.  The one thing that makes AMC more attractive to me is I feel like the price I currently get AMC for is closer to a realistic price for the stock, so if it doesn’t squeeze, I don’t expect to completely loose my shirt. Whereas with GME, buying at 140 and watching it drop to 40 or less is a lot more painful than buying AMC at 8-9 and watching it go to 4-5. And with AMC, it seems more likely that the stock could recover to 7-9 with the reopening before GME could ever recover from 40-50 to 140-150.   🚨🚨Retard Thoughts🚨🚨 Wtf bro if AMC blows up im selling and buying GME. We the people and for the people I stand 👊 Let's hope he will buy GME with it 🙈 Not really everyone knows GME is the only stock worth squeezing. People who push amc are so lost and hanging on by a thread Remember the GME CFO.  Sometimes the bad guys are C-level. Could be a play to demoralize reddit as well. If we had never split our focus from GME to all this stupid BB, AMC, NOK shit we would have squeezed GME already tards. Everyone should have just gone in on GME idiots Come over to GME where papa Ryan Cohen and Reggie fil Aime (ex-president of nintendo of america, yup his on the board too) sing us sweet lullabies on tendies! Meh, it’s a story as old as time.  The executives at the top always get the largest rewards in the form of salaries and bonuses while the employees who actually do the work receive their meager annual 2-3% raises.   That’s the whole reason we need the GME squeeze to succeed. HODL to the Moon!! 🚀 Instructions unclear. Bought more GME. Requesting confirmation. You made it happen retards. Wait until you see the bonuses for the GME execs, bet they’re gonna be to the moon! Hope he bought GME with it. 🚀 Yeah sick of reading about amc.  There isn't even a short squeeze it's just like cineworld or cruise ship stonks.  Going up based on reopening and not going bankrupt.  Buy GME for the squeezening.  AMC literally doing nothing other than not going bankrupt.   GameStop is evolving and kicking out people in charge because they can't do anything to help the company move forward. We actually like the stock for what it is.  Amc just seemed like a side show that was there with NOK and other bs to take away hype, and you monkeys all bought it. Fuck you. Tits are jacked.  You all suck. Positions GME 200 shares @ $400+ 💎🍆🚀🦍💪 You guys might not have the stomach for these sorts of things if news like this upsets you guys.  The fact is, this whole GME/AMC movement helped out a lot of people you'd find despicable.  For a few hedgefuds and CEOs and CFOs we fucked over, tons made bonuses and profit and still actually have the control over the ""to the moon movement"".   Not to mention a lot of little guys are going to get hurt to cover the mess for the big bosses.  Did y'all actually believe any of y'all were doing something noble? lol Everyone saying AMC will go to the moon? Someone else said it’s market cap won’t allow it to reach the same as GME? Can we expect AMC to realistic reach above $50,$100??  Or more Imagine being so much of an idiot that you’d rather take a bonus than riding on the GME wave as AMC has done until now. I mean I’m not mad Monday’s gonna be big for GME. Why the divisiveness? There doesn’t need to be two camps GME vs AMC. Both have compelling reasons to 🚀. Stick together people. 🐒 GME is the real play. But what do I know. Yes. Now sell it all and buy GME. AMC Execs are stealing your money. Sell AMC and buy GME instead. So i am thinking of shorting GME, who's with me - besides Melvin? Exact opposite of what GME is doing, buyer beware. I think, Adam investing 3.75 mil + in GME.  So plz HOLD... Old school CEO, old school antics. Offering for cash raise, fat payout for himself.  GME on the other hand, NO offering, just emojis and ice cream cones.  Guess which one is going higher? GME isn't handling their squeeze to help their business out...at all, which in the long run is horrible for shareholders. AMC paid off a chunk of debt, which is better for shareholders short AND long term. More like in the interest of short term traders. GME is a failing business struggling to turn the corner. If they were smart, they should've issued boatloads of equity at the top. Then used that money to reinvent the business when it eventually returns to a fair valuation. Anyone who didn't sell shares at the top is an idiot. I think both AMC and GME are going to do just fine! Which ever one you’re invested in, or if you’re invested in both, Reap and enjoy the rewards! I’m tired of reading one guy who is in GME say that AMC is not the play and vice versa! When we all make money off both those stocks we should get together and have a GME & AMC victory celebration! Knowing that we put it to those hedge fund pricks!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Because people in GME are for some reason afraid AMC might ruin their “moon ride”. As if the market is dictated by this sub. It’s the other way around. AMC can’t moon without GME. Yeah, AMC actually did something positive with the huge run-up of their stock price.  They probably saved themselves from bankruptcy.  GME hasn’t done anything to capitalize.  I won’t pretend to know what would happen to the stock price short term or for squeeze potential, but GME really could elevate their footing by taking similar sdvantage as AMC. It is definitely good for their business overall.  However, they weren’t exactly in a good place before the pandemic.  Netflix and other streaming services were eating their lunch.  This buys them time to adjust their business model though.  I was in for the short squeeze on both.  I like GME as a long term play more as they are showing they can now change their business model to something more modern. Imagine being a Stan for a mom&pop killer that refuses to pay their employees fair wages and rips off their customers...  *Sincerely, a 5-year manager of GME*  **I like the STOCK but fuck GameStop** Tbf, GME did something similar early last year.  They bought back 7-800 million of their own debt in the form of stock How are they showing that? What separates them from say, Best Buy? They sell video games and consoles and accessories. People flip out on any GME bears around here but.. Sony/Microsoft/Steam/Origin all sell games directly to consumers now. Disc based games are halfway done this generation and completely done next gen.   What ""service"" could Gamestop offer that would generate hundreds of millions of dollars? I was 50/50 but realized the plays felt different. GME appears to actually be repositioning their retail strategies where as AMC seems to be making sure their executives are comfortable This is the way. I’m 76@$172-ish (Have two accounts and don’t want to do math). Only discovered WSB two or three months ago, hence the young account. Bought meme stonks. They pooped. Whatev. Held. Heard about GME/AMC. Bought. Big bump. Held. Big dip. Held. Lots of emotions. Lots of wondering what the fuck am I doing with the only money I have. Held. Here I am now. I just want to be retarded with you guys. Hodling till my wife’s boyfriend gives my eulogy or I step onto the surface of the moon with you turds. The hedgies are really f*ing scared.  Kiplinger's has articles about the ""trend"" of people investing their own money via apps based on meme stocks and directing them to safe and secure (sure to lose) mutual funds.  GME started a movement. The Guppies have morphed into Piranha eating the sharks tendies.  Hair transplant business gonna skyrocket. I have only one doubt, I think there is a chance that those guys from hedges somehow have found the way to trick us and they have covered most of shorts by now. This thought is like a thorn in my brain. Nevertheless I invested as much as I could afford to put in game buying all the way down from 280 to average slightly above 50 and I am going to hold for as long as it makes everybody happy, to the moon. I love this community and I like the stonk and I honestly believe GME company can do really well in future and I dont like those greedy guys that manipulate market and ""earn"" billions of dollars by destroying firms and small investors. And I believe that if many people come together with an honest intention, the universe will do everything for this to allow to happen. I love it and I am not fucking leaving.  Ps. And I want my loved ones to be proud of me if I manage to make our live better and safer, with less worries. I’m a degenerate but I don’t like it if it’s too easy.  Make it difficult for me before we go balls deep.  The funny thing is Melvin and the other short idiots are pulling out all the stops.  Kicking the can down the road, synthetic shares, selling low volume between themselves to drive the price down.  All the while paying interest and praying GME doesn’t perform an accounting of outstanding shares, issue a dividend or recall shares.  And they have to hope there’s no margin call.  By comparison, our job is ridiculously easy.  Just hold.  Just accept the fact that the money is gone, until it moons and suddenly the initial cost disappears and loads of tendies replaces the account.  You’re not going to care what you spent or went in on when your account is seven figures. Stock Markets With Bruce has some great info on his Youtube and Reddit page. I'm subscribing to his theory on GME. There's a reason we did not see GME's stonk price plummet back down to $45 on Friday. It appears that the hedge funds are unloading hundreds of thousands of shares to start a chain reaction of panick selling. If us apes hold strong this bitch can hit the moon potentially on Monday from my understanding.  APES TOGETHER STRONG!!!   This is not financial advice. I'm a retard that chews their own toenails and eats ear wax. Wait wait wait. People sold GME and AMC?!? HOLD!!! GME go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr 🚀💎🚀💎🚀🦍🦍 Whats some good GME calls I'm just annoyed that so many people here (mostly new accounts or long time dormant accounts) are pushing BB as if it is just like GME.  This has always been about GME.  💎🚀 People really don’t realize how many calls expired in the money on Friday. The amount of shares between GME and AMC that need to be covered by Wednesday is mind boggling!!!! LETS FUCKING GO 🚀 🚀 🚀 Buying and holding till the moon or Mars needs ape and yard mentality of keeping it simple and staying United.. $GME folks had it and we have to show the same? Asking questions is normally fine but this is ABNORMAL Well you’re right and wrong in my opinion. GME will likely go up because i’m bullish on Gamestop taking a turn to become massively profitable in the future through e-commerce and e sports etc. This in turn will  force the shortsellers to let the price rise to a more fair valuation.   Where i think you are wrong is as long as Gamestop doesn’t announce and prove their new plans work their valuation will be 20-40 USD and nobody will stop  institutions pushing the price down to this level.  You say they have to cover and need our shares, no they don’t, because they don’t have a time limit on shares and money is not an issue because they are not alone in the game (as proved by melvins bailout) interest is pennies to them. They also make massive profits on up and downswings.   Only way for us to come out with profits is to buy and hold until the company performs! Betting on squeezes is gambling and assuming they play by the rules like we do (last time proved they don’t). I actually like all this bullshit, keeps my attention on GME and I’m not bored or FUD. Victory will taste better than a crayon because we held the line. Even if we lose, we did the best we could & by the rules. It’s my money and I can do with it as I want. Great DD here and the shills give me more drive to buy & hold Offended boomer here. Age 67 and holding my 38 GME shares because I like this “tribe” of people at WSB that like the stock. Holding till the ... lady sings at 1/6 her normal weight. From this very impressed new WSB member who is trying to feed my young family I tip my hat to all holding strong. All boomers are not alike! How sweet would it be to wake up on Monday and find out that GME is offering a special dividend due to holiday sales It was completely inactive until 25 days ago. This sub cannot be trusted for good information anymore. It is completely biased and anything that questions the hive mind is downvoted. If you are looking for good information on GME you will not find it here. Yeah when GME was hovering around 45-50 for like a week I actually got bored. The not knowing what will happen, albeit a little stressful, is exciting. I thought it was over then BAM another bump. Maybe it will happen again, with no stopping this time. Yup sold all my other positions to buy more GME. Was happy with my XX positions in amc at the $8 average. Gme was out of reach for me when this started but slowly started buying as it kept dropping That would be awesome.  GME can take revenge right now.  Remember Melvin tried to drive GameStop in to bankruptcy for years; now the position is reversed.  All they need to do is count all the shares and declare which are counterfeit. Yep, I am a one month account. I’ve always had a TD account that I used for investing, but never very actively. I didn’t know about WSB until the GME craze, and I’ve never traded options before. Index funds and boomer stocks is the bulk of my portfolio.  But another user asked for an idea of how to make some gains while we wait to see what happens with the memes, and I answered his question honestly. There are probably a lot of new members here with the same questions. I just answered his question honestly, with a basic investing move to make a little money (if done properly). Playing the market is about small wins and beating the averages if you can. I wanna hit home runs as bad as anyone, but the more people that realize how to win day-to-day, the better off we will be. Guns or GME? Looks like it’s time for more GME By the time we get that money we can all afford a fractional share of GME. You guys know the Senate still has to pass this right? As long as every Dem votes for it, then it will pass. There are some rumblings from a few members on the left about the bloat of the bill, but if I was a betting man, (I bought GME and AMC at their height, so yes I am) I would still say it gets passed. GME and THC Lol too bad this wasn't approved a few weeks ago so we could get the payments this week. We could unload the mother of all squeezes on GME. Does GME skyrocket when it hits and everyone goes balls deep? Having all those kids is gonna pay off finally!! GME to the moon!!!! The funny part is that I’m still owed the previous 2 checks... all of it going into GME because I like the stock I got a raise in work, yolod a months wages on GME. Never selling That means buy more GME 🚀🚀🚀 Good,  now GME should rocket!! Now everyone can buy some GME 🤣🤣 They might as well just send out GME stonks Ameritard you better drop that stimulus on fucking GME because we like the stock Sorry y'all. I can only commit 90% of this check to GME. The other 10% is for weed (stocks) and weed accessories (stocks)....  There. Fixed it for you. That's like 12 shares of GME at the current price.   A gallon of Jack Daniels.   25' of heavy rope.   One tube of model airplane glue. If everyone puts their stimmy into GME then we may actually initiate lift off This Biden fuck is single handedly keeping GME alive. He thinks this money is going to rent or something important but these retards keeps restocking GME stocks with the cash. By the time this passes the senate $1400 will only be able to buy a fractional share of GME. All the money will go to GME Why doesn't my government give me 14 shares of GME just like that? Unfair :( More GME. Fuck Citadel and Melvin for making fake shares.   We'll fight with real shares. Millions of us, only a few of them. Hedge funds like to preach don’t fight the fed, well this is basically the fed buying GME Government stonks it is!!! GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀 What I see instead is you’ve been approved for 14 more GME shares So glad they took a $3,000 loan out in my name to give $1,600 to their corrupt friends and then give back $1,400 like they're some kind of hero's... But I'm sure they won't ever expect it back.. right? right??  Well, if it's my money anyway, let's make it count! ALL ABOARD GME!!! My american friends will be spending their $1400 on an additional half of a GME stock Married with one kid .. so $1400 to $AMC .. $1400 to $GME .. and $1400 to groceries or $800 yolo calls . 🚀 I hope that you autistic American retards send this straight into GME That's 10 shares of GME @ 140, or 14 @ 100 ""Government can I have **$1400**?""  ""To pay rent?""  ""Yeeees""  **Actually buys $GME like a boss**  **If even just half of the group here spent their stimulus checks on GME shares at an average of $300.00 a share, we could collectively add 22 Million more shares.. And then you would also see a lot more people jumping on/back on board when the price climbs again and the FOMO sets in hah** Just in time for YOLO on GME calls YeaHhh!!! More GME shares!!!! GME stimmy Just to understand WSB; are all of you strictly trying to make massive money off of stocks as fast as possible? In other words, you’re gambling with stocks with high volatility rather than banking on something like Apple, which probably doesn’t have crazy growth potential anymore, but nonetheless, could double as it did the past year, and at worst, wouldn’t drop too much.   I mean, I’m 100% for hurting hedge funds and billionaires who have unlimited resources to manipulate the market and reduce their risk, but as someone whom has no stocks and has never invested, I’m just curious what exactly the general mentality is?  It’s incredibly enticing to see GME jump from $40 to $170 in a day, but that level of risk is scary haha So Now everyone has another 1400 to throw into GME? This is promising.   \*Not Financial advice even though I am an autist The ole GME Stimmy. Coming soon, GME daily buy volume 600 million 🚀💎🚀🦍🦍🦍 AMC and GME is my stimulus check @deepfuckingvalue and ape gang let’s go bananas The stimulus plan should just go straight to GME stock and then use that to fund the 100 trillion dollar 4th Stimmy. It will be a good time to buy some GME and 1 oz of physical silver indeed. $1400 more GME for me. 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍 If AMC and GME go to the moon, there a bunch of retarded apes that aren't going to need stimulus checks. How many shares of $GME can I buy with $1,400?  That check better come quick! Buy the dip @ GME and AMC More GME when it comes in for me I never got my second one... was gonna throw it at GME before it went off. Hopefully that shit happens soon. Because I want more GME! I like the stock. 🤷🏻‍♂️ With GME being in a dip, that means buy more with stimmy I’m just an 🦍 so I’m still not sure that just printing $1400 per person is going to do anything good for the economy or the USD.  But screw it, if this makes it through the Senate I’m going to spend mine on $PLTR and a few shares of $GME for the cause. Funny enough, that’s my exact loss on GME GME about to rocket on those stimmy checks The government is feeding GME Yeah!! Stimmy GME to the moon!!  GME stock packaged approved * Can't wait to put it all in GME And Virginia just legalized weed for 2024 so get on board!!🚀 I like Sundial, Aphria, Tilray, and OF COURSE GME!!!!! Lol what are you guys so excited about? In Canada, we’ve been getting $2,000 a month since March of last year. Where do you think my GME money came from? It's budget reconciliation, this is actually lightning speeds for that process. It's just stupid they have to rely on reconciliation for something we all desperately need. How else can I lose more money on GME if they don't give me more free money? Correct !!!! Oregon over here we love thah STUFF... and GME🚀💎👐🏽 Thinking to throw 10K$ for GME on Mon, maybe I am a big retard but you know we only live once....;) The big companies say we’re out of our mind. That we don’t know what we’re doing that we’re small tule investors, that we’re going to lose all our money that this will go nowhere.  That GME isn’t something that will take us into retirement or success in the long run. I say FUCK EM! I say it’s time us the “little people” show the “big people” that we can control our own futures, that we indeed know what we’re doing and that we indeed believe in our cause and that we are not going to give in and give them what we want, we don’t care how much money they have or how much power they have, UNITED WE WILL SUCCEED, UNITED WE WILL COME OUT ON TOP, UNITED WE WILL MAKE HISTORY! LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE APES OF THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH ONCE UPON A TIME BOARDED A ROCKETSHIP AND FUCKING BLEW IT INTO MOTHERFUCKING SPACE AND LANDED ON PLUTO AND STUCK A $GME FLAG INTO THE GROUND OF SAID PLANET! This for GME or AMC or...? I'm mostly a lurker and I am not taking part of the GME hedgefund takedown (mostly because I don't like the stock). I wanted to say that the memes coming from this is LOLz and making my day. You do you, r/wallstreetbets. Psych and GME are fresh to death!!!(Rewatched 0 to Murder in 60 seconds last night) This Psych/GME crossover is perfect because the whole GME process is just a huge “Wait for iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitt!” GME will die, pull out if you have money in the stock that you can’t lose If Tesla/Elon dropped 100k on GME Monday they could make a lot of money afterward when we all turn around and buy Tesla vehicles/invest in their stock. I know I've seen you all talk about it. I’m holding, bought more GME on Friday after hours I know this is a really dumb question but should I buy a GME stock at the current price of $99? I can only afford 1 but I want to be retarded and ask my wife’s boyfriend if he can scoot over Should I buy more GME then? That is creepy as fuck. Seriously what the hell is wrong with you cultists that makes you stalk people's profiles like that?   And yeah, sure, many of y'all will learn valuable lessons from this. That's part of why I try so hard to warn y'all, so that you can maybe learn the easy way rather than the hard way. Though when I mentioned ""learn by doing"", I wasn't talking about blindly throwing money into something hyped up and just deluding yourself into thinking it'll go up forever because....reasons. I was talking more about doing research and deciding whether something is a good investment or not, because it's one thing to ""practice"" DD, but it's definitely not the same as when you're putting your actual money on the line.   Also after going through that kreepytoe bubble, I know what mania and delusion looks like. Y'all are no different, it's the same story, but hopefully some of y'all will learn to recognize the signs of ""new paradigm"" delusion. Anytime it's going up, you're convinced it's good and genuine movement, and then when it's going down you scream about manipulation and short ladders and other BS. The c-word sub did the same thing in 2018.   Of course you're also overlooking some pretty critical differences between the banned c-word and a struggling company that's losing money, but that's neither here nor there. I have a feeling from your comment that it would be a waste of time trying to discuss those differences with you so whatevs, enjoy your tendies when GME totes hits 10k or whatever. I'd like to get this sub back, and actually be enjoyable instead of being overrun with copium, conspiracy (sHoRT LaDdeRs aTtacK!!), and other bs from delusional GME bagholding cultists. Also idk maybe I have some sort of hope that people will see reason and maybe won't lose their asses on something so easily avoidable. Well after that bet, the wife and kids are probably gonna live at the wifes boyfreinds house. So might as well sell or remortgage the house and buy more GME with that too. I like GME Hi fellow retards!  My hypothesis and granted this may have already been postulated here is that the hedgers had enough liquidity in Jan to short GME and temper the price back down. Now it appears that they’ve run out of liquidity and are forced to sell their income generating securities to continue to short in an act of desperation.   As a parallel - consider it from a mortgage perspective they’re trying to stave of foreclosure by first burning through savings and now they’re selling off their valuable possessions. So they can’t borrow off margin, they are out of cash and now they’re selling off their source of income. Which by the way hurts the passive investors that like their ETF stocks, but the hedges don’t give a shit. They just want to short GME no matter the cost.   The mortgage allegory reminds me of say the 2008 crisis - I used to be a loan officer and the exotic sub prime mortgages were horse shit. You could qualify for a mortgage back then with a DTI (debt to income ratio) of 65%. For those unaware DTI is the ratio of your GROSS income vs the PITI of your home and all revolving and installment debt on your credit report. It does not factor in payments for utilities, food, gas. So they assume people can afford a house with the 35% of gross fucking income after their monthly debt is paid? No. Now the opposite is happening again. They deserve this for their insatiable greed and lack of compassion for anyone but themselves.   Hedgies have no cash and selling their income generating stocks to continue this fight. Eventually they’ll run out of those and will have no choice but to cover no matter the price. They fucking deserve it. From their ashes I hope we can build a market that is free and open without their influence and heavy shorting a float will be illegal. If I want to pay x dollars for a stock, that’s my business. Shorting is bullshit. Think a company is overvalued? Then close your position and find another fucking stock. The government should be appalled. Trying to BK a company not only puts thousands out of a job, but reduces the income tax stream from them to the gov’t. Not only that but now they’re on the govt payroll via unemployment. All this so they can profit off of destruction. Fuck. You. Long post I’m sorry.  TLDR: hedgies are going to burn for their atrocities.   My position: 914 shares of GME and one 3/5 $100 call. The shares I’d be willing to part with for say a minimum of 4 figures per share. Maybe 5 who knows? 42,069 per share has a nice ring to it. I like the stock and this isn’t financial advice. Hedge funds are cucks. I’m holding over 20k worth of GME. Let’s get rich Your mention of loaning crazy DTI ratios in 2008 paralells the nearly 10 fold increase we've seen in GME shorting fees over the past week. It would seem that if your borrowing costs rose 10 fold you'd move to other investments... but we are seeing nearly the opposite.   My other scattered thoughts are below, curious to know what you think.   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In my opinion we do not currently have accurate short interest numbers, and perhaps never did considering all the potential ways to disguise it. As soon as hedgies knew we relied on that number, it ceased to become a reliable metric.   We all saw Melvin Capital lie about closing their positions pre-squeeze, we all saw CNBC try to divert us with SLV, and we all heard the IB president said if more of those calls were exercised on the 27th/28th it would've crashed everything. We didn't see short fees this high back then, nor did we see no available shares to short like we did on the 25th.  If this blows up we all know the effects it could have on the greater system, and for this reason hedgies are doubling down. In their mind they win both ways, either profiting off shorts by manipulating us all to sell, or getting bailed out by the govt if it all blows up.  Looking at upcoming option contracts: every single expiry has more puts than calls (OI).   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.  Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.  &#x200B;  Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. They tried this last week and failed, and the fight must continue if the squeeze is to be squoze. I have one share of GME and if that's all I can contribute...well then am proud to do so. I salute you all! They aren't running out of anything without buying pressure to fill FTDs. These guys have billions to play with and they are making money buying dips and selling options too. They are slowly covering because of limited supply. Once inflation heats up bond yields will shrink the market and suddenly their money pool will become less plentiful. That's when the squeeze will squozen in my retarded opinion.  Synthetic shares are infinite as long as the price points land perfectly. That's why price should be ignored because it's being manipulated to get tens of millions in calls and shorts. Also notice only losses are being advertised and not gains by the media. Why did they ""bail out"" Melvin? The inflation incoming will prove their short positions right before GME can change longterm. Just buy, hold, until the tendieman cometh. They'll eventually win, but we'll win first.  NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE AND JUST CRAYON INFUSED MUSINGS. My investments are small compared to others (over about 3 weeks I got 1 share in GME), but they are what I can do: anything to take down the economic oligarchy and restore the meaning of a free market I am NOT Selling my GME till 10k per share. The amount of volume vs float is what hasn’t made sense to me since the big January move. What’s stopping hedge funds from exercising ITM calls (at 2x their short position) at a strike well below market thereby covering their short and taking a long position? In this scenario, the market makers in Chicago would be the ones scrambling to find shares to deliver, not the hedges. Anyone have thoughts on this possibility or is my brain as smooth as a marble?  My position: 500 shares of GME, holding till valhalla No real evidence other than a market downturn that should have been happening. Hedge funds are not a monolith, there are likely some pushing GME up as well as others pushing it down. We don't evidence that the ones pushing it down are actually running out of cash. For all we know the money they made shorting the last run-up gave them more than ever.  I'm tired of these shit-tier posts that aren't remotely helpful to anyone. Also shorts are just a part of the market. They should be disclosed more transparently, we shouldn't get updates every two weeks, we should get them daily, or better yet hourly the same way we get other data, but they shouldn't be eliminated entirely, that's just stupid.  Stock manipulation is already illegal, what we actually need is an SEC that has its balls, that can hunt down the ones destroying companies for profit on a regular basis, not just when it becomes popular. I have 60 shares of GME now and if i will be adding more at every opportunity along the way 🤲💎🚀. Not letting go until 5 digits I’m very smooth brain ape. I sold 33 GME at 150. Then bought 50 shares with the same money. I like the stock. I don’t like HF I’m a new ape with only a couple of shares of GME.  How can you be so sure this will play out in our favor ????  Very novice player here. I am 100% buying more GME on the dip next week. Probably can get away with another... $300-500 worth when it dips. Get myself a cool 10 shares or so probably. I have zero GME shares. Come monday morning, I'm buying atleast 50 shares.  Let's gooooo Here’s what I don’t understand, could somebody explain this to me...  We see reports that there’s less stock available to short, which I presume is a good thing. Yet, from what I read previously, GME had over 100% of its stock shorted at one point. If it’s possible to short over 100% of the stock, how can it be that we are running out of stock to short? JUST A GUESS,,, but I think opening bell the Heggies will hammer GME to drive the stock down,,, might be a good time to pick up a few more shares.,, I ought to get some 30k worth of insurance money nect week for an accident a couple years ago, wish me luck. All will be invested into GMEEEE $GME can only go up from here, my dog told me so. Glad you wrote this stuff out at ape level. I'm so fucking tired of reading shit like ""oh well everyone said it was def gonna moon in january, look what happened...they stopped it. nothing will ever happen, they'll just cheat again"".   Bruh... there are not infinite cheat codes for these guys. Blowing their load trying to stop what was happening in January worked to a point, BUT it also put a TREMENDOUS amount of global scrutiny on the situation. That has been and will be working against them.  There's a LOT less tolerance for big money fuckery with GME et al at this point. It already went in front of Congress, so there's no doubt that all eyes are on the situation -- the feigned ignorance and confusion from MMs, RH, Citadel, etc. won't work again for them.   The options left to extricate them are dwindling... beyond what they can do, IMHO, the only remaining possibility to stop the inevitable MOASS would be interventions by regulators, etc. that would be so absolutely cataclysmic to the entire market, global confidence in the system, etc.   Regulators and big money damn sure aren't going to burn the whole market down to save a few players from imploding in historical fashion. They may be running out of bullets, but maybe it is because the 100 trillion dollar bond market took a dump faster than they were expecting...so maybe it is more like they close their position in GME because who cares about picking up a $20 bill from the ground after you just rolled your Mercedes off an embankment.  Either way same outcome. Oh they are fucked. Shorting AMC GME and now welcome to the top shorted list SOS. I’m buying 50,000 shares at $5.00 when they open up on Monday. We are going to bankrupt them all. Apes strong. I have hypothesized this same thing. The observable correlation between the rise in GME and AMC stock and the decline of other stocks like TSLA was uncanny.   There is this old adage that, ""the stock market is a reflection of rich people's feelings.""  My supposition as to why HFs are willing to sell off all assets may be as simple as the pay off for successfully shorting out GME would be massive. Perhaps enough for them to breaking even, or stave off financial ruin.   If the stock market is a reflection of rich people's feelings, they are pissed. But furthermore, I see a now that there are also a zhit ton of apes that far outnumber the elite. We like the stock.   Your theory is much more developed than mine, for I am just a chimp that had been given a 🔫. No one should take anything I wroteded here as financial advice. This post is providing me with confirmation bias. The reality is that hedge funds daytrade GME, the retailers lift the stock in pre market then the hedges funds bring it back to where it was and close their positions before the bell then the stock goes up again and so and so. This happens everyday. The only people losing are the holders. Wonder how much I can get for my star wars figure collection? 2 GME shares maybe? Since Disney screwed the franchise. Everyone saying AMC will go to the moon? Someone else said it’s market cap won’t allow it to reach the same as GME? Can we expect AMC to realistically reach above $50,$100??  Or more So there are still some left. We should keep seeing a rise/fall pattern for at least another 2 weeks. Then either trading GME will be completely halted or we will get our chicken tendies from mcdonalds. I like GME and everything but you really shouldn’t use the word “literally” when you mean “figuratively” New DD I read on the GME sub speculates they can go till 3/19 before everything falls apart. Not sure if it's correct but there's a big writeup (over my head). By literally everything especially GME I wonder if all of u will ever realize for every one of you retail investors buying GME there’s another retail trader shorting it. ,💎🙌💎GME is at a reasonable rate now so hurry up and buy yours before it gets to 3 digits. Buy low and sell higher when we reach Jupiter🚀🚀🚀 If you believe that Melvin and co. are offloading their external shares to short GME, buy those at a cheaper price. If Melvin does win, they might buy back the stock they just sold. If or when that stock rises, sell the peak for tendies.  I am not a financial services professional. I have no idea what I'm even doing with my own life let alone yours. At $42,069/share, GME would have a market capitalization of $3 trillion dollars.  That’s three Amazons  🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍🦍 If the stocks go back down I believe many people that were hesitant before will be jumping on board. Myself I am mad my profile is not ape 💩retarded with just GME all the way down GME on sale next week. Hmmm What to sell for more GME Yeah. I just looked at the largest institutional owners of GME stock and saw they were the biggest boys in the yard. The shorts are the small frys. Know they shorting mean to hedge GME you mean? The price spiking once can be dismissed as a fluke for people with reservations to the stock. The second time it happened it solidified the play for *a lot* of people.   My partner who I kept updated with GME since January just listened to me while i kept him up to date with the events. This weekend he gave me money so he could get in when it dips. I'm pretty sure conversations like this are taking place across the world as we speak. If GME release one freaking positive PR it could be enough to light the fuse on this thing Nothing wrong with that. We aren’t driving per se but we’re a contributor to it. IIRC during the squeeze last month, WSB owned an aggregate of at least 5% of GME which is no small feat. Our participation matters. Just gotta keep grinding! Nothing is certain. However it’s become clear they have still a significant amount of GME shorted for a reason. If they all covered their positions as they claimed they’d have no reason to continue to short.  We held than $100 line this week which to me is encouraging. Just 💎 🤚! I disagree. It touched 200 on Thursday. First time in almost a month. GME hasn’t unveiled their platform yet which is big. Still a new CFO to be named and Papa Cohen still has the ability to buy 6% more shares. Upping his stake by 50% to the tune of around 4M shares. I think that’s move the needle in our favor. Shorting has its merits, but in my opinion there needs to be transparency as well as a hard cap on the % of float that can be shorted. Shorting is too easy for the hedgies to use and abuse which they can and do at will with enough volume to have a noticeably negative impact. They don’t usually do it because of the fundamentals, but for profit. It’s bullshit what they can do to a stock - screwing over honest ppl who actually believe in the stock they invested in by shorting it to increase their profitability. Apple is the most valuable company in the world. They had a great earnings call this month. No reason to lose over 10 bucks of share in value like they have. I saw SAVA and TLRY shoot up in value and close at I think 117 and 65 or so respectively one day. Why? So higher OTM options are rolled out the next day. What happens the next day? Price falls by 50% rendering those OTM calls useless. First time GME shot to 150 - they were allowed to because they stopped shorting for a brief period. Why? To have any limit sells trigger in the 100-150 range and that day 150 was the highest OTM call option available. Shenanigans!! If there were no shares to float then they’d have to cover. Or at some point GME could offer us a buyback for a nice sum. 🚀🚀🚀 What about 3 GME shares?! 🧐🤔🧐 Probably, just a question of how much they’ll allow you to use for GME. Sure. I bought a call option with a strike price of $100 that expires on Friday, March 5th at a premium of $35.00. Call options give the buyer the right, but not the obligation to buy 100 units of a security - in this case GME stock at the strike price for a premium dictated by the market. The premium ebbs and flows with the stock price of the security. Since call options occur in units of 100 and the premium is $35 - that means I paid $3.5k to purchase the call option guaranteeing my ability to purchase 100 shares of GME at the strike price of $100 on or before the date of expiry (3/5).   The kicker here is that I’m bullish on GME and believe the stock will go up a significant amount this week. In order for the call option to be profitable to me I need the stock price of GME to be at or above $135. Reason being, I’m paying $100/share for the stock if I exercise the option, but I also paid $35/share in order to purchase the premium. Total cost to execute the call option is $10k for the 100 shares. So in all I paid $13,500 for 100 shares of GME. 10k for the shares and 3.5k for the premium I paid to purchase the option. If GME is trading above the strike price it’s a profit for me since my cost basis for each share is locked at $100. If it’s below it’s a loss and if it’s at $135 I break even.   With call options you have 3 choices once purchased:  1) Exercise the option as discussed above purchasing the 100 shares for $100 each.  2) Sell it. You can resell call options to the market at a profit or loss depending on how the stock is trading for. The premium you can sell it for is related to how many days left until expiry and the current price of the stock. Stock goes up, price of premium goes up, etc.   3) Let it expire worthless. You’d lose the premium you paid but that’s it.   I hope this helps! SOS is actually still to high. Its a $2 stock selling for more than double of what its actually worth. But we could say the same about GME I sold my old GPUs and bought GME. I normally invest exclusively in Beanie Babies. So as you could imagine, I've got money to burn.  I've bought 3 GME shares. Thinking of buying another. Nah. Retail is certainly moving the GME ticker. Or at least, allowing the ticker to swing wildly. The more shares that are held, the less liquidity to the market makers, less liquidity = more price fluctuations. It happens as a sort of asymptotic curve though. So as retail buys more and more, there’s not much effect until we hold a critical mass of it. That’s when the spikes start happening. Can you link up to date institutional ownership numbers? I can't find up to date numbers and so we don't really know who owns the most GME. There is a case to be made retail investors gobbled up a bunch this week. large brokers hold GME in funds and indexes and sell to take profit as prices increase. Likewise buy at lows. Computer driven. 90 day,  end of day not in effect after late trading I believe. I screwed up this week,  let 3 limit orders expire on $GME $AMC No offense, but I think you're not quite right here. If it hit 10,500, given the negative correlation with the market as GME rises, FB's market cap would be lower than it currently is. So, GME might not even have to hit 5 figures to surpass FB's market cap. SEC was looking into halting training on GME and 14 other stocks due to some social media market manipulation BS.   Just remember all these people and government/social structures are against us. Jokes on them. I have a wife and 2 kids. That’s $5,600 buying up more GME shares. Imagine the panic when they see the number of apes buying GME double, even triple overnight, just when they're all tapped out of their dirty market tricks. It’s possible. When VW had its squeeze there wasn’t near the retail fervor there is now. It rose to over 1k from 200. If another squeeze starts a lot of ppl won’t want to miss out so a lot of FOMO sentiment. So if VW can crest 1k I see no reason GME can’t beat that mark. 5k? I dunno, but feels like with retail 2k+ isn’t necessarily a mathematical impossibility. Remember - the potential loss of shorting a stock is infinite. Whereas buying the stock your risk is no higher than the price you paid vs the current value of the stock itself. Nobody knows how high it will go, but by definition - any number is a statistical possibility. 10k is possible. Will it happen? Unlikely. But you just never know for sure. FFS NO ONE CARES ABOUT UR TERRIBLE GME AND AMC PLAYS BRUH YOU FUCKING CLOWNS ARE RUINING WSB I don’t take GME seriously but the last round which led to a serious surge also had a half a million share trade around the same time so I thought I’d post Not my kind of music but it's ahout GME so now it become my type of music.  This is the WAY. I have just enough brain cells left after listening to this to understand buy and hold GME. I didnt eat yesterday so I'd have extra money to buy GME To start off with, I have to say that this post is not intended to spread FUD or to discourage people. This is a post to help us “plan for the worst and hope for the best”. It is to open a discussion with people more knowledgeable than myself who can help clear up some of these issues.  &#x200B;  While commenting on another post I started to realise some of the ways the hedge funds could try and climb out of this hole they have dug, or at least screw us over in the process of a squeeze. I have not seen these points being discussed nor do I know of any solid reasons why they couldn’t happen.  There is evidence that the shorts have already used illegal actions to supress the price and delay a full squeeze on GameStop. I cannot comment on whether they DEFINITELY committed any crimes, but in the interest of risk management I think we all need to presume they have done, and will do again.  You see, when an organisation has as much money as some of these hedge funds, they have power as well. Real power. Most people would presume the age of the 1% getting away with everything has passed, but it has just become more subtle. As the world saw in 2008, these people can and do get away with their crimes, even if it destroys entire economies.  Anyway, to get to the point, I have been thinking about multiple ways the shorts can and possibly will try and save themselves, or at least stop us from seeing the full potential of the squeeze.  \[Note: Some of these points are aimed directly at brokerages, but with the possibility that hedge funds may have pulled strings to manipulate the brokers in mind. i.e., Actions of brokerages that directly benefit the short sellers.\]  \[Note 2: This whole post is to be taken as a question of sorts. I am not stating facts, merely presenting problems. If anyone actually knows the definitive answer or likelihood to any of these problems then please comment.\]  &#x200B;  * **Brokerages block the ‘sell’ option.**  Considering our problem last time was them blocking buys, this might not immediately seem like such a bad thing, because that would mean the price would only go up, right?  Stopping further short selling would benefit us as the price couldn’t be supressed as much, but stopping us from selling would just mean the price would go up, and we’d be left watching as we are unable to ever sell. As much as I am willing to hold forever if I have to, we are all hoping for it to reach such a price where we would sell eventually.  But wouldn’t this be illegal? Would it? I thought that blocking buys would be illegal but apparently not. If they can block the buys they can probably block the sells as well – they bury a lot of manipulative and controlling stuff in their terms and conditions. If anyone with a greater understanding of the law knows about the legality of restricting selling could let us know then that would be helpful.  &#x200B;  * **Brokerages allow people to sell at extreme profits, but refuse to pay the astronomical prices.**  This is one that definitely **should** be illegal, and something even the most untouchable couldn’t get away with. With that said, I don’t feel comfortable resting everything on a ‘should’. Whether you think it at all possible or not, imagine if the massive target of $30million per share actually happens. Can you really see all these brokerages just coughing up straight away without any fuss?  Or, is it at all possible that they could yet again hide behind legal loopholes and fine print to refrain from paying us those amounts? “There is a maximum amount you can have in your account at one time”, “This is over the maximum amount of money we can handle in a transaction”, “Due to the extreme volatility of this stock, sell order could not be processed, the number you are seeing on screen is incorrect and will be removed from your account. Do not try to withdraw any of this money.” The list goes on.  I especially want to make it clear here that I am asking if any of this is possible. I am a bit of an idiot but I think a discussion is worth having on these matters, because as far as I am concerned, everything is on the table and nothing is too farfetched.  &#x200B;  * **Brokerages artificially fake outages and failures, blocking people from using their services and pretending they were just overwhelmed with the extreme, sudden increase in volume of users again.**  How do we know they haven’t already done this? They can stop people from trading freely while blaming technology and even the large amount of people using their service.  &#x200B;  * **Hedge funds digitally attacking brokerages to cut off a large chunk of retail investors and lock them out of the squeeze.**  Is it possible the hedge funds could pay others to attack the brokerages digitally, whether through something like a DDoS attack or other methods? I imagine they would especially target the large no-commission brokers like Robinhood and T212.  It also seems to me like it would be a difficult crime to trace back to the hedge funds, and I actually see very little reason why hedge funds wouldn’t be able to do this. With the amount of money the hedgies are set to lose, they are going to be desperate and willing to resort to desperate measures. If this did happen and we were unable to sell then would we be entitled to compensation?  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  # THE BIG ONE.  **\[Update:** I have had numerous people commenting with good explanations of the following point. I am now considering 'THE BIG ONE' not so big anymore, and thank you all for your input.\]  If the main shorts responsible for all of this go bankrupt before they are able to buy back every single share they’d have to, what would happen then?  If the numbers people are estimating are even close to the true possible number then I would say it’s very likely they’d go bankrupt very quickly. It is my understanding that most debts of sorts are written off when a company or organisation files for bankruptcy, which is the main reason some people force their own companies into bankruptcy only the re-launch with a different name and no debt.  If we really do destroy the hedge funds that are behind the majority of the short positions, then do we destroy ourselves in the process? I can’t see them being forces to pay up billions upon billions in debt if they are bankrupt, because they would never reasonably obtain that money. In that case, who is going to pay?  My best guess is that in one the worst case scenarios the price skyrockets as they cover as much as they can and then it just stops when they run out of money. No one else is going to voluntarily buy those shares at those prices so wouldn’t we end up with GME stalling at an insane price but with no one able to sell and no one able to buy, meaning the share price would just… stop?  If that did happen then I can’t see the SEC or the US Government (simply because it’s a US stock) doing nothing as for the first time a stock get’s infinitely stuck. Therefore, would they then artificially lower the price to get people buying again? This would mean none of us could actually sell at the price it reaches.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  If you even made it this far you are all probably pissed off at me for saying it over and over, but I am NOT claiming any of this will happen. The last thing I want to do is unintentionally spread FUD. I’m presuming some will call me a shill anyway for even bringing these points up but I need to clarify that I am invested in GME and I am confident that it will squeeze at some point. I am 100% in this cause, and I don’t believe this is any reason for people to worry or be demotivated.  With that said, I am not so naïve as to presume this will all go perfectly for us with no obstacles – just look at last time when they stopped us from buying and killed the upwards momentum. We need to be as best prepared as we can, and ideally we need a legal ‘mutually assured destruction’ to dissuade anything I have mentioned here.  What I am asking for is for people to PLEASE prove me wrong. If any of you have a greater knowledge of the law or the inner workings of things then please comment and let us all know.  &#x200B;  Thank you to anyone who may be able to help. Imagine GME indefinitely sitting on the NYSE at 420,690 a share lol I am a bit concerned reading all those negative replies. People, this is stock market and lots of money on a plate. Dont behave like a bunch of cult warshipers who reject to hear anything that doesnt match their perspective. I am in GME, all the way with you to the moon but things may go in many different ways we cant predict so its kind of wise to have a little discussion and bringing up all possible scenarios.   Honestly, replies like this one for example makes me think we aarent going to win it because most folks are morons. This is a serious situation and should be held with at least minimum  seriousness which I cant find much of here.  "" The fact that you care this much to “warn” people that we could be fucked tells me that you have incentive to do so. Go home Melvin  Edit: I didn’t actually read. Too many words that don’t confirm my opinion. Plus no 🚀 or 💎.So again, fuck off."" You left out the most likely scenario IF this actually rockets and we get screwed.  The SEC steps in and halts everything related to GME.  No trading at all.    They acknowledge the huge price has the potential to send the whole market spiraling as funds and brokers would go bankrupt.  They come up with a ""fair"" price the short holders must pay into a fund, take your shares from you at that price, pay you put of said fund,  and then a month or two down the line release those shares back into the wild at a set price similar to an IPO.    They'll let this game go on for a while, and they may even let it get up to high hundreds or a thousand per share but they won't let the whole market burn over this.  $69,420 per share isn't happening.  I'm getting out before it does anyway.  Once it hits the absolute peak you can smash the sell button all you want on the way down.  Doubtful you'll get matched with a buyer at $50k and falling. You missed one scenario... GME issues new shares and all the sudden all the fake shares we all own become real and worthless because shorts have no shortage of shares to cover with now. PL:DR BUY more! Sell your dog, sell your wife, sell your neighbor's wife and her bf; buy more and hold. This is not financial advice, I'm just a crayon eating tard.  P.S.   WTS Slightly used wife. Taking payments in form of GME/AMC Shares, coupons (Preferably Mcdonald's), and cash I have never been comfortable with GME as a selection for this great short. Ryan Cohen who is a Billionaire, Invested 70 Million into GME back in August. How much do you think he has already made for himself to date on this. I would have preferred a shorted company that does human care, drugs, social justice issues or something more appropriate to send a message to Citadel  I do appreciate the authors guide and suggestions as their are many good points and I honor you for your opinion I'm worried about investors shares of GME (that are held on apps and electronically) being lent out to cover the short positions of the HF and then placed back in our accounts after they have sold off leaving us share holders with the bag. So buy more GME and AMC. Got it How bored are most of you GMEAnon people? umm.. the GME crew is fucked if they put more than their lunch money in. Thats the current joke, but people are actually  thinking believing GME is still a thing. I dont get it. Yeah very good point. It's a shame though because I imagine the SEC would let GME get driven into the ground and not bat an eye. This is very unlikely.  Everyone needs to drop back down to reality.  I am deep in GME.  We are not seeing $10k per share. Come on.  Here is the reality this battle gets dragged out for months the price continues to spike, drop, trade sideways etc.  At the next earnings price spikes again to $150 maybe $200 because GME reports a profit and a game plan on how to transform.    Continues on another positive earnings price goes up and stays up.  At some point when it becomes obvious that GME is a company with real finanicals it will be traded that way and the share price will stabilize.  I can't pretend to know the final stabilized price but the shorts will eventually limp, stumble, crawl from their short positions beat up and bleeding. Market won't implode.  Remember shorts are only in to make money.  When it becomes hard to make money shorting GME the will move on. Thank you.  With what you said on the chain of responsibility, I would be interested to see a model/simulation that estimates how many steps up that chain get bankrupted if GME hits different prices. For example: If it peaked at $1k, would it just be the Hedge Funds who have to absorb that hit, whereas if it hit $100k/share would that destroy the hedgies, brokerages and clearing houses etc.   A lot of unknowns involved in that though so I don't imagine anyone has tried to make a guestimate yet - but still, like I said, it would be interesting to see.   Thanks for the help. So you don't have to read, I'll tell you here. I AM invested in GME and am heavily in the red but I'm still holding. As I commented once before: ""I dove into this dick first and I'm not pulling out until I cum tendies"".  What benefits me is that people don't all panic sell if the squeeze doesn't happen when people are expecting it to, or if any of the things I mentioned actually happen.   I won't ask you to read the whole thing, but please just flick through and read the bullet points at least, and the last section 'The Big One' I think is important for all of us.  Look at last time. I didn't expect the brokerages to fuck us over like that. That is the sort of situation I am trying to avoid. If everyone is aware and prepared this time there won't be such a sell off from people that would otherwise hold. I have a big stake in GME and if you don’t think any of these are possible you are delusional. Any of these scenarios are super fucking possible. Including the government just saying “yeah this shit isn’t happening anymore” and literally freeze everything . I’m not in GME but wish you the best Adding to the SEC interference. If GME gets halted, option contract owners with expiries during the halt will be fucked— as far as I know. If you’re up on contracts, maybe roll into some shares. Won’t get the ridiculous leverage but you’ll also be safe from that fuckery should it materialize. AMC shit just seems more suspect by the day imo. It’s like a shit movie, where the clock stops like 1-2 seconds before the bomb goes off, in reference to amc finishing at 8.01, it’s like one big setup to me.  Just trying to distract us from GME IMO. AMC was never the move. If people never bought AMC, GME would be at $2,000 right now Why did AMC even become a thing? It’s only ever truly been about GME. And in case you missed Part 1 from your GME fam: [https: youtu.be/oFb3SvbfwuU](https: youtu.be/oFb3SvbfwuU) In my humble opinion only, if GME ever holds a shareholder meeting with its shareholders, it will find that us apes own more stock than registered at the exchange in its entirety (about 70M shares registered, and I guesstimate we already own 200M shares, 130M of which are fraudulent) this fraudulent share bag can only be transferred to other bagholders until it is covered. I am just an ape that will hodl, with a propensity to buy more. The Robinhood IPO will almost certainly be a success. I personally moved from RH to Fidelity after January and I know a lot of people here did too. But we are not the entire retail market. Plenty of retail traders didn't have a stake in GME so they will stay with RH. The only people moving from RH are those that are involved enough to track GME daily and watch the congressional hearing (a lot of people, but not enough to hurt the IPO). The reality of the matter is that RH has the absolute best UI for mobile trading and it will stay that way until Fidelity puts serious effort into their UI because as of right now their mobile app kinda sucks, but its desktop version is better than RH. Besides, do you really think Citadel would let the RH IPO tank? Step 1: Take GME gains  Step 2: Short the Shit out of Robinhood   Step 3: More Profit. This is a terrible idea.  Don't short something because you want it to go down.  Short it because you think it's going down.  This whole GME thing has actually been nothing but good for RH.  They got billions more in cash.  It's the hottest pre-ipo stock right now.  They got millions of free publicity off this, and most people don't give a shit about GME. robinhood IPO could be a trap, they will throw a WSB hated company in hopes people will try to short to the ground, they might try to create a hype with bot accounts. so when there is enough short position by WSB, hedgies send it to moon to swap your GMEs with RH shorts. just some tinfoil talking robinhood IPO could be a trap, they will throw a WSB hated company in hopes people will try to short to the ground, they might try to create a hype with bot accounts. so when there is enough short position by WSB, hedgies send it to moon to swap your GMEs with RH shorts. just some tinfoil talking Bb and amc are good stock even without wsb. Ppl do your research on BB n AMC. They are both doing deals and making moves that will make them🚀. With or without wsb. BB n AMC are the go too right now. GME is good to if they finalize a couple of deals they are negotiating! This is not financial advice. So GME has something like 20,000 bots ( spread across twitter, facebook, tiktok and reddit) pumping up the stock, likely each posting more than a average human would:  [https: www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-robots/bots-hyped-up-gamestop-on-major-social-media-platforms-analysis-finds-idUSKBN2AQ2BH](https: www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-robots/bots-hyped-up-gamestop-on-major-social-media-platforms-analysis-finds-idUSKBN2AQ2BH)  So you have to ask yourself, how useful is this data if hedgefunds and more devious players have been using bots to pump the stock on the side? I'd be doing exactly the opposite of what the HF's want, and that is to ignore the hype and never think about going long until it's back to fair value of around 15$. Don't be a sheep and believe the HF's bullshit - you really think their algos aren't making a busload of money going long and short on stocks when it suits them? Not to mention the money they make selling OTM calls/puts to us retards. The implied volatility intraday on Friday reached a high of around 600% on March 19 options!! That shit is crazy expensive and totally unsustainable!! DYOR I think GME was a one off. The stars aligned if you look at the low float (69 million) and over 100% short. However, FSR could be similar to a few others that received attention in the wallstreetbets community. It seems most similar to Tilray. Tilray had sector momentum then a price target upgrade. It had modest backing from conventional analysts. Fundamentally it is more sound than the other stocks with big runs in this community. It reached double it's highest price target before falling back to 🌎. I think Fisker could get to $80 near term. Even if it falls after reaching $80, I think it will be back. So GME will reach $2570 by next week? Buying more on Monday! GME is like the KingKong of stonks right now So fucking sick of GME. Can you guys fuck off please? Ruined a community if PLTR goes even for me @30, im definitely selling it for more GME Lol WSB only cares about GME they ain’t in it for the AMC trend fuck these guys don’t come here for amc go somewhere else boys. Wow GME stayed stiff Watched it multiple times and imagined that’s the GME price going 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Someone explain to me how Quicken Loans (RKT) is 4th in ticker mentions? I work in the financial services industry and that stock is dumb af to invest in. Just go all in on GME AMC has only 16% of short float when GME has 60% !  SELL AMC BUY GME !  [https: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P00011H0G](https: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P00011H0G) SNDL could be an easy quick 100-300% gain again like last time Pump it up then take those profits to buy more GME to hold! I legitimately can't decide whether to buy more RKT to hold long or trade. This comment chain is like after 20 GME, 20 PLTR, and 15 AMC comments, you retards need to start looking past memes to see what legit buys (or other legit buys if you aren't ready to move past memes) are on the market right now. As someone who holds GME and AMC, I have a lot more faith in AMC making me money. RKT IPOed last year, they're actually profitable and making a shit load of money. They killed earnings and gave a special dividen out (all this during a dam pandemin). Where you not around when RKT was like the top meme stock on this sub for like a good 2 weeks? RKT is a good companie, I sold my FDs last Fri for a good profit.  Possitions 900shares of GME on margin and selling weekly FDs to all you retards I see your guys point but I just don’t think you can get as much hype behind a mortgage stock like you can GME. Interest rates are going up and the company isn’t going to experience growth in the upcoming quarters. What’s the research on 50 a share ? Not trying to argue just genuinely curious. Starting to look interesting I still like the GME stock but it seems to be an orchestrated dead cat bounce to get retail to FOMO in. Take a look at WSB and it clearly worked. It'll probably happen 2-3 more times in the future because people will bet the farm that GME goes up another 100-800% (and they would probably diamond hand for more because infinity gazillion is not a meme). Meanwhile, RKT is straight up free tendies with no downside risk. My prediction is that when RKT lands on the moon, the 7,000,000 new WSB members will FOMO in at the last minute (see Tilray, APHA, GME, AMC, NOK, BB, PLTR, etc...), and be stuck with the bag again. Then they will hate on whatever the next best play is before FOMOing into the top again. When do you buy your GME calls and at what premium? New to trading, what is CALL GME,that is not a stock is it? He bought call options for GME Capital gains don’t count. The CRA only checks to see if you exceed your annual contribution limit. I have heard of TSLA TFSA millionaires getting fucked by the CRA and taxed because of the vague TFSA trading rules. But honestly if GME moons then A tax is the last thing I’ll be thinking about Think there will be separation colonies on the moon, those who go there on GME and those who took the AMC shuttle. Like mini gang wars... tell my kids, we don't go to that part of the moon, thats where the AMC people live... hahah :D Team Player Here......Took the AMC play cuz I could get more shares to help the team more than I could do for the GME gang Oh the irony in him singing the best things in life are free but laid over a meme encouraging us to hang in there to our shares in hopes of making more money. I’m just as guilty. Have my shares in amc and GME and need that cash for materialistic things and to pay off school debt. AMC and GME to the Moon AMC dilutes shares like crazy and gives their CEO a massive bonus for doing nothing...and you guys would rather invest in it than GME. AMC is simply a sympathy play that won't be nearly as profitable as GME in the long run. The other way around is accessable to more people. I would only be able to buy a small fraction of GME shares as opposed to AMC. Not everyone has thousands of dollars to bet on $50 per stock. (Record skips)  Go shorty, it's our GME. We gonna party like the moon landing. We gonna take this rocket to past infinity. And you know we got them diamond hands for all our tendies. I woke up 5am today, because I was knocked out at 830 last night and writing to you guys now. Why is that relevant? Because I'm also one of the dumb apes in on this, reading reddit daily since the Jan 29th debacle. I decided to write this for many reasons, read if yall want. One of the reasons is I don't or can't talk to anyone right now about Gme for obvious reasons. ""sell that shit, the volume doesn't look right, well TV said this bla bla bla""   JUST FUCKING DIAMOND HANDS. Jesus christ buddha  No proof or DD just opinions.   1. First things first, what people have to realize is our society is based on and run on profits. (more so in America) Financial, health, food, education industry, all them big dogs 1% etc want profits.   2. Now that you know that, they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make said profits. Some stay in the straight and narrow, the rest is that 1%. I get it, you want to make money, everyone does. So they find ways to evade tax, pay off people, make friends with higher-ups coughgovernmentofficials. This is all theory. Take it as you will.   3. I explain 1 and 2 because it leads me to 3. Jan 28th or 29th or whatever, all I needed to read was some hf was suspicious of ""making things up to profit"" and unfortunately got caught by Mr dfv.   4. 1 2 and 3 is what leads me to believe at that point that the squeeze is real. I read absolutely no DD and know nothing about stocks, and never read anything on wsb because I don't bet on what I can't win. I opened up Fidelity account cuz you know. RH. That was the other thing that set me off. RH, read 1 and 2.  Below are just rants now.   5. The squeeze is real. Read 1 & 2 & 3  6. You ain't diamond hands unless you read like 20 DDs minimum a day. To be a diamond hand, don't worry about shills and all those short ladder attack, Silver, open court cases, short interests reports, dips, tweets etc, because read 1, 2 and 3. That's all you need to care about.   7. The more I read DDs since early February, the more I bought in, like 3 times actually.   8. To me in the beginning, this was not an investment but a BET. Hence wsB. But the bet payout was this:  A. In the beginning my head was, spend 10 dollars, you get 3 outcomes. You only lose maybe 1 to 3 dollars Max, if you bought low like 40 to 60 maybe. Ok we lose SOME money, just don't eat out next time or work an extra week or something for those of us fortunate to do so. Remember this is a BET. don't use what you can't afford.   B. You break even and get your money back, GME ain't going bankrupt ever, read the DDs, Ryan Cohen and crew. Also read 1 2 and 3, it's in media now.   C. With 10 dollars you make $1000 right? Win win? Nah dog, this payout is going to be 100k share +. Again read 1, 2 and 3. And now this went from a BET to an investment. Why? Because I don't bet what I can't win. I'm cheap like that.   9. Now people are day trading. To me it's like buying a 20 dollar scratch ticket to win 40 dollars. Then betting and buying more scratch ticket hoping you win, yall gonna sell and miss the squeeze guys, read 1 2 and 3 HODL. OR you can buy a 1 dollar scratch ticket, HODL for a rainy day and win 100k or more, multiplier of other apes holding too.  10. This is a once and lifetime opportunity. It's like going on let's make a deal TV show. You take the $2000 cash instead of picking what's behind curtain 1 2 and 3. Where in this case the curtain is certainly going to have alot more money and there's literally no zonks. Why? Read 1 2 and 3, that's why yall should HODL.   This is a roller-coaster of a ride. It went from me wanting to screw hedge funds over to me paying off my cc debts, to me paying off my house to me retiring, to me now wanting to do philanthropy and open businesses to help the regular folk and change peoples lives. But you can't do that shit with 10k a share or even 100k a share. It needs  fuck you money. Let's ALL make fuck you money guys. Apes strong, thanks for listening. I have no one to share this ride with. Please don't block me. Good luck guys, stay safe. Get some fucking sleep and stop reading reddit so much and just watch the ticker, cuz it's going to blast off as long as we hold. Why? Read 1, 2 and 3.  This is not financial advice etc. Just observation and personal opinions. Im pretty sure there's real data out there from those conspiracy heads but I'm too lazy to prove it and you know, read #2. This could all also blow over and we make no profit and doesn't blast off cuz why? Read #2.  TLDR: companies caught with pants down doing shady things for profit. We found out, it's an opportunity for a squeeze. All you need to know is these guys will do whatever it takes to get away with it. Hold, don't sell low, no need to day trade, wait for the squeeze, and we all make fuck you money. Everything else isn't worth reading or worrying about. God speed.   Edit: forgot TLDR: What do people honestly think AMC and GME will reach? I keep reading the 100k etc, but I'm slightly sceptic. (GME DD) Why the Volkswagen Comparison is much more inaccurate than you thought, but in A DIFFERENT WAY Hey folks! I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.  Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:  So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101). I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:     TL;DR: You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.    Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic. Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:  you start with ~0~ shares you borrow one from a broker you now have ~1~ shares you sell that share, completing your short you now have ~0~ shares  Now imagine the short squeeze happens. And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc. The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).  Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high: Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital.  You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.  you start with ~0~ shares you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker! you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!  Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with!  Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value:   THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?  Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy. Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.   If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations. Now think about that again.   Effective TL;DR 2.0:  People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule? Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.  But here’s MY question: What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it?  VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.   Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not. Joy to all, ~Unimportant   (this is not financial advise, and I am not a financial advisor) I believe you are misunderstanding the nature of shorting. You can not cover an infinite number of short positions with one share. Short selling one share **does** in fact leave you with -1 share. You have a debt to whomever you borrowed that share from. Upon repurchasing the share, it is not yours. The share is returned to its rightful owner. The owner of that sure could sell it to another hedge fund with a short position if they wanted to, but that would be no different from said hedge fund buying it from the open market.   Naked short selling on the other hand is more easily seen as shorting in reverse. Instead of locating a share to borrow, a counterfeit share is created and sold into the market. This counterfeit share is an IOU and is a debt to the buyer for one share. When this naked short position is covered, the one who created it must go to the market and buy a share, then give it to the owner.   The main difference is that with standard shorting an original share exists and is held by person A. That share is then borrowed and sold to person B. This **doubles** that number of shares. Logically speaking, only 100% of the float can ever be shorted, as this would double the float. That means one synthetic share for every original share in existence; every share would be shorted. Whereas naked shorting produces IOUs, meaning some of these original shares must be purchased and delivered to those who bought the IOUs. The issue arises when there aren’t enough shares on the market to fulfill the IOUs that you have written (i.e. how do you fulfill 100 million IOUs if only 60 million of that thing exist).   This leads to the main misconception with the VW squeeze. VW **did not** have a larger short float ratio than GME currently does. If you will recall correctly, the VW squeeze happened because Porsche announced it had purchased a large amount of shares, which left institutional ownership at 99%. Your claim is that this left the ratio at 13:1. ***What does that then mean for GME’s institutional ownership of ~140%, and short interest of 78%?*** GME has a negative float and is significantly worse for short sellers than in VW’s situation. With VW there were the 12.8% of synthetic shares diluting it’s organic float, in addition to the 1% of organic float that wasn’t owned by institutions. Institutions own a significant amount more of the original float than has ever existed in GME, therefore the short float ratio is infinitely higher than VWs. This is due to the fact that institutions own roughly ~35 million synthetic shares (i.e. borrowed or shorted shares) that would need to be repurchased by shorts. Without institutional liquidation, it is impossible for shorts to cover. no this question is super legit - what i'm also thinking about - it's great that all are holding in expectation of the squeeze n all n let's assume it does pan out - the thing i'm thinking is that while theoretically possible for the price to go up continuously let's be realistic and pragmatic here - for one if price does reach some exorbitant level i think perhaps regulators will step in to ""broker"" some type of a deal b/w holders - HF's and GME itself; but what is more realistic is profit taking sales at certain threshold levels will be inevitable, now of course that does not add more ""new"" shares to the mix so the over-shorted thesis will still remain but then when will this cycle end and how? Because let's be honest here  - while GME is probably currently benefiting from all the publicity ( i say they should list at least 10B of Goodwill on Balance Sheet for this saga), as i say while they are benefiting in terms of publicity i bet at one point they would like for things to settle and get on w their restructuring plan to make Game-Stop great again.... I have always wondered something. This is as good a place as any. I think this stuff all becomes ""funny money"" pretty quickly. You guys remember the mortgage meltdown of 08-09? The easiest way I could sum it up is, the financial products had so quickly and drastically outpaced the actual physical asset (the house) that it about broke the entire financial system of America.   Our whole economy is kind of built on BS at this point. Do you guys think the GME is the same thing? Do you think there are so many leveraging devices (I don't know what else to call them) that there is more money involved than there even is a physical asset? In this case the share? Maybe:  Hedge funds / shorts talking (aka colluding) with each other to execute a schedule when to exit their short positions. It's in their best interest to not exit around the same time for obvious reasons; GME will go uncontrollably parabolic  I feel like they will throw in the towel but methodically for purposss to mitigate gigantic losses  Hedge Fund A: cover $5B XYZ date  Hedge Fund B: cover $7B XYZ date  Hedge Fund C: cover $8B XYZ date   If they can control the narrative, they can control the losses   Just a random thought 🤷🏻‍♂️ So in essence SYNTHETIC SHORTING by the HEDGE FUNDS provide us with very powerful ROCKET FUEL that will take us not just to the moon but a whole other GALAXY.  Im buying more GME on Monday. Im just trying to figure out CALL strategy from here on out They just buying time till the rules get changed. What I don't get is if the shared are all owned by someone. How was someone able to buy 10 million shares on Feb 24 2021 from 2:40-3:40 before the market closed and it drove the price up from $50 to $150.  edit: I got about \~200 GME shares Why? Because I drive a VW and can't get anywhere with GME. Except TO THE MOON!1!!1! The thing that I don't understand is that there is an upper limit to the GME price, as at some point, assuming the hedges do have to buy back the shares and they don't find some loophole trickery, they are only worth so much. They can't print money out of thin air to pay for shares at infinite value. I'm curious what the absolute maximum could be before they just decided they'd rather decide to declare bankruptcy or something and not have to pay anyone. True: -GME and Volkswagen are not comps in many ways, but they are likely the two biggest short squeezes of all time. -Gme seems to be the bigger squeeze, and definitely the longer lasting one. Now throw in the second coming of said GME short squeeze, even if the second coming, is not an actual short squeeze.  In short: yes you’re right, it is historic.   WTFs:   -Every share can legally be sold short three times. -Each share has a unique code and is tracked. -So, What naked short selling, are you referring to? -The Volkswagen situation had to do with shorts, yes, but focusing on how GME HAD more outstanding shorts than Volkswagen while ignoring that the Volkswagen  float was minuscule since Porsche was basically holding it all. In fact Porsche are the ones who released the squeeze by putting some of the shares back on the market, to let institutions escape. After all, down the road when things change they would still be visible to said institutions, unlike individual investors...  So what exactly is the big idea? The GME squeeze is bigger? Yes, it was. That therefore it will last longer? It already did. That the comparison that was made to Volkswagen to explain to people what was happening was in fact not the same trade? True, again. And therefore you must continue to make money into the future, because the mechanics that were present will continue in your favor until you have your fill, as long as you come up with threads to pull at, no matter the lack of transparency in current conditions? Good luck 2U! Why are folks still harping about short squeeze? It's not short squeeze anymore it's gamma squeeze.   Listen to IB CEO Peterffy explaining why he needed to shut down trading of GME. I'll try to explain it for you.   Calls options especially lotto types far exceeded the outstanding amount and no one is selling the options. Say you have 50mil of total float. Due to gamma squeeze, the amount of crazy lotto call options that are now in the money spiked to 150mil. This means the brokers that sold you the options needed to buy 150mil shares to deliver to 🦍🦍🦍. But when the total float available (not even counting shorts) is only 50mil, where else are they going to buy the remaining 100mil from? The only reasonable answer is from short sellers. But shorts are already peeing their pants. Who else is willing to short? Hence the price will shoot up stratospherically in order for short sellers to take on the risk to short 100mil more shares.  Go google Peterffy GME. He explained everything in the YouTube video.  https: youtu.be/_TPYuIRVfew But keep in mind the HF that shorted doesn’t have to cover their full naked short position at once unless forced to. If I shorted GME by 140% and think the public is out to fuck me over I’d cover 1-2% a day and slowly wait the the price to drop to minimize my losses. What’s preventing them from doing that? Guys what happens when they declare bankruptcy without having covered their naked shares?  Even if they cant funnel money through borderline illegal oversea subsidiaries there will come a point(maybe we're already there) where all their assets literally can't cover their naked shorts since they will cause a squeeze when they start.   As i understand it GME has no obligation to care about these shares, the only thing that gives them value is the hedge funds.   I literally know jack shit so can someone explain who has to cover their remaining naked shorts? The main problem with your thesis is that Melvin already admitted to losing over half their capital in January, a loss of several billions, claiming to have covered their shorts on Tuesday when volume spiked to 178 million shares and price was as high as $150.   Furthermore, VW squeeze spiked at 5X the price. GME spiked 10x over a week and 100x over six months.   TL;DR: GME already squeezed more than VW ever did back in January. So you’re saying GME 🚀🌕? I heard GME is a pretty cool thing to buy.   Once this moons and comes back down I think I'm going to get some. Basically we are the hedge funds debt... (GME shareholders) and the hedge funds are printing more and more shares to cover their debt.... except instead of devaluation of the the share you are making it infinitely more expensive... people holding real shares are like the national debt that can never really be paid back. Because GME would be worth So.... Much.... Money.     Please correct me if my interpretation is way off... It's not. Retail is just a fraction of GME. Completely. In that the various mechanisms working around GME have basically superseded any level they should’ve been able to reach... considering also the theory you can find on the GME subreddit, which I encourage you read, it seems that indeed some very large actors are predicting a large market-wide decline by March 19th. Check the GME subreddit, they have a post implicated March 19th... it seems possible.  But even stretching it somewhat is unlikely, no one would agree to be the last schmuck who will have paid millions and billions in interest as everyone else leaves. Oh, they still pay interest! Look it up, they are treated the same. And yes, they are called back in that all fake shares are removed to ensure voting power goes to authentic holders, last I remember.  My idea is that a naked short removes counterfeit shares from the market when closed, and that this simply also means that normal shorts will not be able to be closed as more than 100% of GME shares are already owned. They are not “tagged differently”, they just fundamentally work differently.  Either that or by institutions/retail giving up shares, which is the sadder and more likely route! Good warning! But this is a little (very) different in that GME now, unlike the market then, has a situation based far more on fundamentals than speculation. Short squeezes are nothing more than math! It depends. See, I would have entirely agreed with this a week ago, but as there are increasing signs of bullish whale involvement, I think there might be just as much if not more institutional pressure on our side as theirs. Furthermore, the insane number of puts bought across large cap stocks for March 19th (and the similarly large number of GME calls for that date) suggests that very large players are still expecting a big market hit from a big GME gain near that date.  I wouldn’t lose all hope just yet. Not really, from my point of view. As far as I’m aware, AMC short interest is not over 100% (I could be wrong!), so I’m not sure. Anyway, I don’t mean to be a gay bear, but I’ve always seen GME as a better opportunity. I would look it up on other Reddit posts, particularly the Endgame March 19th post on the GME subreddit, or otherwise search it, but I don’t have it myself on hand. Sorry! They openly admitted under oath during the house committee that the January price surge was mostly due to a gamma squeeze + retail hype, not a short squeeze.  ""Covered their shorts"" could mean anything but buying on the market, such as swapping out their shorts for fresh ones, including under ETFs, or transferring them from Melvin to another entity. Like paying off a bank loan with a credit card.  Total ownership is still above x3 of issued shares at the most conservative estimates of retail ownership, suggesting over a hundred million shorted shares, as opposed to \~30M in the disclosed short interest. Strategic FTDs are still ongoing in massive numbers, and has surged in ETFs containing GME, another solid indicator of over-shorting. I get some of your points, but your TL;DR seems to me to be based in bad logic. The 5x squeeze being smaller than the GME gains does not syllogistically lead to the fact that GME has already squeezed... most significant insider sources from RH and people like IB’s Peterffy have pointed out multiple times that the squeeze is what was *barely stopped* from occurring by the share limitations.  Also, you are countering my above logic providing data from Melvin: given hedge fund’s track record of not caring about the fines attached to huge lies, and given the very situation which seems to face them given said logic, why should we trust them?   TL;DR: I don’t think so... HA! You’re a Saudi prince with an oil fortune, that’s cute, I have GME shares! Beat it geek. 💎💎💎💎💎💎💎🧑🏼‍🚀🤴🏻 I’m not quite understanding.  If there are 100 shares of GME outstanding and Melvin borrows 1 and then sells it, it’s still one share that’s floating around the market.  One share they they are obligated to buy back and return eventually.  If they sell a share but don’t own any and don’t borrow any then what did they sell?  Is there now 100 shares and 1 contract that says “you buy this nothingness from me at current GME price and I’ll back it back from you when GME is hopefully lower”?  So now Melvin is obligated to buy back this “contract” thus returning the market to only 100 shares of GME?  Or do the sum of all GME shares in everyone’s trading account actually exceed the number of outstanding shares that GME has sold? Ya thankfully GME is the hedge against market collapse at this point, it's the only thing keeping my portfolio green ahahaha Oh? Are you thinking GME might get higher? Neptune higher or Alpha Centauri higher?  Give it to me in astronomical units! 🤤🚀💥 I'll put on my seat belt. If its truly about to get that bad, like market collapse bad...the rules will be rewritten where they will suspend short interest for GME. Allowing the HF to cover on their own time and not tank the economy. Which will stop any squeeze in its tracks I sold enough to cover original cost and believe enough in RC to turn this ship around long term. Only small percent of portfolio is dedicated to GME It's publicly available information and can be googled pretty quick. Wealthy institutions own a minimum of about 75% of the stock. They trade more shares of it in a day than the people of this sub do in a week.  If you want to know who actually pushed these surges in price, a good group to start with might be Morgan Stanley. Weeks before each surge, they've purchased large volumes of GME - right before January's surge, they went from just a few thousand to 2 million. One week before February's surge, they doubled up from 2 million to 4 million.  Then, they only needed to push a large volume of calls to push the price up - which happened just hours before each spike. I don't know the details about that but made a quick search and i think they are not comparable situations.""Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions""  I think the market will indeed crash and that GME will be the reason why, same as it did because of the CDO's.  Source: [https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis](https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis) Thank you for looking out for a fellow GME bull, I saved myself! They didn’t “sell” anything, realistically. What happens is, the DTCC awards the person they sold it to a placeholder, duplicate “counterfeit” share. The total becomes 101! The idea is the hedge funds will buy 1 share off the market, and give it to the DTCC, which liquidates it to return the total to 100.  So yes, the current number of shares does exceed that which GME has ever issued, and yes, Melvin is obligated to buy them back and while doing so will decrease the number of shares on the market. Check the GME subreddit! No worries at all. I deeply enjoy talking about this topic, and having been involved in GME since November, I’ve learned a lot. However, I certainly have a lot more to learn.   And unfortunately no, we are still not in agreement. The statement that one share could be used to cover an infinite amount of shares if the owners of other shares decided to sell in a chain is very misleading, as this still results in more than one share being purchased.   The fact of the matter is that the one share cover chain is no different than going to the market and buying the same number of shares outright, since the same number of shares will be purchased in the end.   The key thing to consider is the destructive nature of covering a short; it is much, much easier to think of needing to cover a short as a debt, rather than directly relating to the original share itself. We can do this because when a share is shorted, it is duplicated. You now have two shares in the market, while only one exists, right? Think of it like making a photo copy of a paper share certificate and selling it. By buying a share to “cover,” you’re removing that duplicate from circulation. It is destroyed, and now you are only left with the original.   Thinking of it in this way, you can see that the original share has not changed in the process. The person selling their share after someone has covered the borrow, is the same exact thing as someone selling a share on the open market. The whole idea of the chain is irrelevant and only goes to confuse the concept.   For example:  1 share is bought on the open market and destroyed to cover share A;  Share A is purchased and destroyed to cover share B;  Share B is purchased and destroyed to cover share C;  Share C is purchased and destroyed to cover share D;  And finally, Share D is purchased and destroyed to cover share E.  While yes, you have covered five shorted shares through this process, you have also purchased five shares, not one. You are now only left with ONE share, share E. This is because the other shares that were purchased were destroyed in the process of covering.   This is no different in execution than just going to the market and buying five shares to cover all five short positions. In this scenario you are left with five shares after they are covered. Either way, you are still buying five shares in order to cover five shares, and destroying the same amount in the process. The difference is that one is using a smaller pool of shares. The example of the cover chain utilizes 6 total shares, whereas the outright purchase example uses 10. This is why you are left with 4 more shares in the latter.   The loop of the cover chain makes the process appear more confusing than it is, and is simply demonstrating covering a short position using a smaller number of shares only to be left with a smaller number of shares, rather than covering with more shares and being left with more.  Covering a short position condenses the overall shares in the market, and the cover chain example just looks at it from a very close perspective. When GME, AMC go to the moon. DD on where to invest next. I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.  By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.  Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/  First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!!   Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink.   Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here.   By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.  Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.  When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.  UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!  Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.  Space Ape out  TLDR:   * $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU * $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI * $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot * $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds * $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon  EDIT: Fresh data in.... Added Wendys and the 100k moon prediction If I could recommend, after you sell your GME during the squeeze, wait for it to tank...and then buy GME I ape, but listen....listen.....  AMC small boom———>GME BIG BOOM.  GME ENDGAME.  Not investor, I APE.  (Ape’s laugh and screech) if it reaches $150k I'll tattoo ""GME Stonks"" on my arm I'm actually long GME. Regardless of the squeeze. I'll sell if/when I see big money, but not all of it. And I'll likely rebuy after the sonic boom we're all expecting. There will never be another incident like GME again.  Ever.  And we haven’t even seen the fallout that’s coming up to the market lol I literally was thinking about all of the tattoo artists that are going to be charging double anytime somebody says they want a diamond hands, GME, or ape riding a rocket ship. I mean, that's what I'd do if somebody came in to get a tattoo because they just won a bunch of money at the casino. https: m.youtube.com/watch?v=uuVgvab1gSg  Solid DD on GME technicals Dude stfu. It’s not next. It’s now. The only plays are AMC and GME. Consistently for the next 31 months. Until then there will be no other “plays”. Now go make your money fool. 13 more days till it goes public and kids spend money on it like we do GME and AMC... I watch my kids play it while I eat there box of crayons 🖍 buying stonk To all of you apes that consider buying into GME but hesitate because you want to find the perfect entry point You will NEVER find it... that‘s just how it is. Believe it or not, but finding the perfect entry and perfect exit point is pure luck.  So you can wait and hope for GME to dip some more so you can buy in more cheaply, but chances are at least as high that it takes off soon 🚀🚀🚀 and you missed your chance - thinking „I wish I bought in @100 rather than @250+.“  What you learn from that? Well assuming you believe that GME has a solid chance of reaching 1‘000$ and more, it simply does not matter whether your entry point was @100 or @80 or @150.  Tldr: You will not find it, so just BUY while it still is in the 2-3 digit range (Edit: given that you believe in this rocket)! 🚀🚀🚀🚀  Obligatory: This is not financial advice, just my personal opinion and I like the stock. If you haven't done your DD on GME, consider looking at the *extensive* research u/DeepFuckingValue aka Roaring Kitty has done on it. Which suggests, from an informed standpoint, that it is worth 20-50. Maybe more since obviously pivoting for hopefully the better is in fact taking place at the management level. The big companies say we’re out of our mind. That we don’t know what we’re doing that we’re small tule investors, that we’re going to lose all our money that this will go nowhere.  That GME isn’t something that will take us into retirement or success in the long run. I say FUCK EM! I say it’s time us the “little people” show the “big people” that we can control our own futures, that we indeed know what we’re doing and that we indeed believe in our cause and that we are not going to give in and give them what we want, we don’t care how much money they have or how much power they have, UNITED WE WILL SUCCEED, UNITED WE WILL COME OUT ON TOP, UNITED WE WILL MAKE HISTORY! LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE APES OF THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH ONCE UPON A TIME BOARDED A ROCKETSHIP AND FUCKING BLEW IT INTO MOTHERFUCKING SPACE AND LANDED ON PLUTO AND STUCK A $GME FLAG INTO THE GROUND OF SAID PLANET! I saw GME go from $39 to $53 in a few hours so I knew what I had to do.... > Well assuming you believe that GME has a solid chance of reaching 1‘000$ and more, it simply does not matter whether your entry point was @100 or @80 or @150.  the worst part about reading this is that the math and logic was all there. This was very obviously gonna hit 4 digits if brokers werent allowed to do a plethora of illegal shit I mean I'm happy you guys are making money on this but a lot of people are losing. This is just general advice but there are perfect entry points. I very much doubt that GME will make it to $1000 without a huge announcement of some sort. I believe the company can make it but as of right now the stock is overpriced and hyped up. This reminds me of when Pokemon Go first came out. Just another fad. Frak, you read my mind. I was right on the fence waiting for 99.00 at the last 5 mins. Not giving up I will do this. Once I'm in I'll never you let go... GME I was going to close my RH account since I stopped using it and moved to ETrade but they wouldn't let their money from the ""free"" partial share go so I placed an order for Monday:     You have submitted a market order to buy 0.021904 shares of GME. You  can check on the status of this order on Robinhood. We will notify you  when this order has been executed.   If you have any questions, you can [**contact us**](https: robinhood.com/contact).   – The Robinhood Team  (p.s. FUCK YOU RH) i really don’t think GME is going to go as high as you guys think it is It is really hard to find the tops and bottoms so here is what you can do if you are still on the fence. Divide what you were going to put into GME into 3-5. Buy GME with one portion now. It goes to the moon, you are in baby. If it dips, buy with another portion. I found that buying into whatever price made me feel like I didn't lose out because I am at least partially in. I dunno, 80 @$40 defo preferable than 11 @$300. But maybe that's just my smooth brain talking!  I'll try and get more stonks if GME goes sub $50 to bring my average down. But either way, I'm happy to be on the rocket 🚀  💎👐 AMC > GME Would buying that etf that shall not be named be the same as getting GME but at a cheaper price? Agreed. I started buying stonks on Monday. My cost per stonk is $120.99. And this last weeks it’s seen as low as $45. Then it went up, then it went down. I’ve made 4 different purchases this week. All pretty much at its high points cause I’m retarded as fuck!! But I don’t give as shit, cause $120 a stonk ain’t shit when it his $10k a stonk!!   I refinanced my house to build a rental. Guess I won’t be building a rental cause I blew every penny on this shit!!   1138 stonks of GME says I’ll be building ten in place of one!!!   I don’t really like this stonk, I fucking love it. Have you even been in one of these stores!?   🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Blast off retards!! If Elon knew what was best for him, he’d get to Mars faster with GME than spacex!!  Boom!!🚀 So... is this still happening? GME or Virgin Galactic? Everyone buys in, some lose some win.  Them's the breaks.   CAPITALISM.  I MEAN MOON GME TO THE MOON. Bullshit, anyone who knows Technical Analysis could see on Weekly chart GME would drop back to around $38 before it would Bounce back up. The middle of the Bollinger Band on Weekly was $38 so it only made sense it would come back to Fill the Gap...it's one thing I've noticed here since joining, there's a Ton of Apes presenting DD research but not a single TA chart to be found.   WTF is wrong with you apes?...Trade like a Gorilla and don't fall for the monkey business. https: m.youtube.com/watch?v=uuVgvab1gSg  Solid video on GME analysis This is dumb advice. It’s basically telling you FOMO buying is ok. This is exactly how a lot of people lost a ton of money in the first round of GME craze. Those who made money got in early. I'm all about GME, but you're delusional if you think it'll go beyond the ""3 digit range"". I'd love to see any data you have that says otherwise. Don’t lie to them. The perfect time to buy GME is...  Monday - Friday every morning when the market opens! Hahaha!! 🦍🦍🦍🦍.   This is not financial advice. Buying GME for me is like buying my favorite bananas, I buy them because I like bananas. And I’m not sharing my bananas with anyone. I bought one GME share at $40 and was talking to my spouse when it was at around $200 who was like “how many!? JUST ONE?!” But when i mentioned I have 100 of AMC at $7.77 (a significant number for me so i have found it easier to hold) it became “YOU SPENT $700 ON AMC?” “Well more like $800” “Can you pay rent this month?!”   But now guess who wants to buy in? ☺️☺️☺️ I’ve made peace with potentially losing the 20ish grand I have in the market by putting it all on GME. Fortune favors the bold. Let’s go boys. When was the perfect time to buy GME? When all the paper handed fools gave up on it. Bought 45 shares @$44.39 💎🙌🏼🚀 If you didn’t buy in after DFV doubled down, you’re a true retard 🦍 GME is trash. Once all the hoopla is over it’s gonna go back down to 20. Unless the new CEO pivots into something exciting. It's funny seeing retards like you encourage new investors to hop on GME ""before they miss the train""   Seriously fuck off lmao. GME is a gamble play at this point. Anyone who entered under 50$ I salute you. Otherwise yall just investing with emotions. Goodluck retards. Instead of buying Into GME buy into AMC boys and girls don’t make a $20 profit make a $20000 with amc GME already had its squeeze don’t be dumb by listening to these GME dudes that are losing money it’s too late but not for AMC!!! Hi man don‘t take it as advice... I am just saying you will never find the right time... but still if you personally think the risk is too high right now then probably don‘t buy but wait (and yes maybe you miss the rocket but it was in line with your risk tolerance, maybe it will even turn out do have been a good decision if the price drops). I‘m just saying if you think GME may reach 1000 or more then you might not want to wait for 10$ changes but make sure you are in... Generally speaking I agree with you but GME is not a normally behaving stock where you can do a technical analysis - or did you preview the breakout from around 40 to 170? So yes it is in a way gambling BUT what I tried to express in this post is that if you have the true belief that GME can go up more than 500 or even 1000 then it does not matter so much where you‘re entry point is in the current price range... No but anyone doing basic technical analysis could of told you $40 was a strong support level and a relatively safe spot to buy. I know you want GME to go up, as do I. But telling people to just flat out buy at any price is actually retarded. Fractional share of GME Specifically this post   https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltxm3c/uranium_tickers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  You’re telling me an account with less than 30 days, posts one time about uranium, gets flooded with random ass awards, proceeds to shit on any opposing comments without providing some kind of DD/evidence, and still has the post up after 7 hours? If you’re familiar with how WSB posts usually go, you know something is unusual about the thread. Comments feel off, interaction isn’t there, responses all feel off.  One response looks like it’s straight up a copy-paste format  https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltxm3c/uranium_tickers/gp372g1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3  WHO THE FUCK TALKS LIKE THAT? “Famous Big Short investor Michael Burry”    All I’m saying is there is some suspicious retards here. Invest in uranium if you think it’s a good investment. If you want to post a DD, actually post DD. Don’t just list tickers, post a one or two line abstract as to why people should throw money at it. Get some $ROPE  Positions: GME 8@100, GME 300C@3/5, AMC 12C@3/19 I respect the size of your nuts on that GME FD call after Friday. I like uranium as a play for fundamental reasons. But that preceded the GME squeeze by months.  Short version: nuclear is the future of electricity. Depleted nuclear material is used in anti tank rounds and we just got an administration who wants to fund clean energy and the military industrial complex.  And similar to other metals the miners are cheap stocks that can hump based on demand. Unlike other metals it can't easily scale up mining. You can always hire more workers and rent more silver/gold mining equipment. But Radioactive resistant equipment and workers trained and willing to work with uranium are not ad abundant He had bought 2/26 calls earlier (3 at a $50 strike, 1 at $51, 1 at $65). He sold to close those positions and lock in profits, instead of exercising (had he exercised he'd have received 500 shares at an average cost of $53.20/share).   He then took what he made and bought 3/5 calls at $120 strike. He paid $33.95 for each of those contracts, so he will make money on the new trade if GME closes over $153.95 on 3/5.  Compared to the alternative--spending the same $30,000 on 300 shares--his strategy will not break even unless GME closes over $180 on March 5th, but for each dollar over $180 GME closes on March 5th, he'll make 3× as much (because he has 9 options vs 300 shares). If GME does not close over $120 by Friday the options will be worthless, whereas if he bought shares they would be worth something.  So to answer your question, OP is expecting GME goes over $180 by Friday March 5th. Made this in the earlier stages of the $GME battle. Got a couple of sequels planned out if you apes like this. Yea this is backwards as fuck lol. 2 weeks ago WSB wanted nothing to do with GME What price is GME and AMC stocks supposed to be next week? I am behind and in dire need to know where to put a couple hundred dollars quickly AMC is gonna go uppppppp  🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀  GME is for losers no.   apes strong together.   GME and AMC to the moon. won't lie i am drunk and am trying to get into a reddit argument as quickly as possible as part of a contest, big up GME GME First hype chart vs second - Where I think we are at In the picture the larger photo is the first GME 'squeeze' back in January.  The smaller picture in the top left corner is from last week.  I notice a very close similarity between the two.  Is this where GME is at heading into next week?!  Not saying we will hit the same highs.. but this does look familiar.  Edit: Volume is also near identical.  https: preview.redd.it/y65lcymby5k61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=8086d88825581d58217ccef8205fc649e2592ab6 Tl;dr there will be a squeeze and a gamma because stimmies. Set calls for April and profit off of the IV Crush. Hedgies want the little people in because free money and this may be the catalyst.   Longer version:  I think there will be a squeeze and the gamma will happen when the stimmies drop. I think both will happen within the next 3 weeks. The shorties already know this and are preparing.   Not a lot of people remember this, but when the squeeze happened in January HFS blamed the government and stimulus checks for giving people the power to take their profits. They did the same with Hertz.   Wouldn’t it make more sense that the hedgies are also waiting for the stimmies to drop because GME is a “meme” stock; meaning social media directly influences it, and can cause a gamma when people throw their $1400 stimmies at gme? Cash app finally added gme so now ANYONE can buy the stock. The stimulus is arriving soon. GME is a meme stock, meaning the whole world is watching. HFs are not foolish enough to ignore all this and they are preparing for GMAGGEDON. The mother of all squeezes is coming. Look at the calls/put activity. It’s all there in plain sight. Pay attention is all I’m saying. Don’t be afraid to profit off of the mini squeeze coming and throw it back in for the gamma that is pending as well. This is the one time where the little people can can throw in a billion+ combined into a stock they believe will stick it to the man. I’ll end that statement there. I don’t want to put too much out there (more than I already have).   I think many of us apes already knew this, I just want newcomers really to know a tiny piece of what the REAL play is here.   Anyways, I am an ignorant ape who knows nothing. Not financial advice If I remember correctly, Elon tweeted in Jan and after that the stock rocketed up (that big jump you see after the 26th of Jan). https: twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703?s=20  Celebrity clout then. He hasn’t done that now.  I bought GME. I don’t think the gains will be like last time. I seriously wonder if I should make a post to clear up the air on this because people are WAY overthinking this causing very foolish and brash bets that seem ludicrous to me. I agree with you on the mini squeeze, but I think Wednesday we may see a big jump and then a plummet by Friday. This isn’t anything new though. GME was being manipulated this way long before DFV jumped in. It’s honestly a cow that theoretically can produce infinite milk and will continue to be shorted until the gamma squeeze happens. Im in 56 @ $29.5ish and even though Ive might have jumped the ship a little too fast, I have full faith in their business.  They have been getting big goverment deals and they are moving more into retail as well. From my understanding they are also gonna help keeping an overview of who have been vaccinated for covid.  It has a high chance of going places and staying at those places because of their sticky model. They become rooted into the bunisesses they have contracts with.  &#x200B;  If GME goes to the moon there is a good chance some of that is being tossed into PLTR. sold and bought more GME . The risk to reward for GME is insane right now. Even if i lose all my money (which i wont maybe  half} this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.  &#x200B;  167 @ 87 GME To The Moon I bought 12@343. I’ve got nothing better to do than hold. And breaking even isn’t worth it.   I choose to go to the moon. I choose to go to the moon with you apes not because it is easy but because it is hard. Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.  Edit: Thanks for the silver. If I could use it to buy more GME, I would.  Edit: Good morning, /r/wallstreetbets. This got more attention than it was worth, but it looks like we all had fun. See all you apestronauts on the moon. No fancy stuff from this hodler. Just a GME MOD request. Figure out a way to prove we hodlers own more than the float of GME!   Make 0 mistake, this is exactly how Tesla got into sp500--to give the system endless boomer retirement money to get out of their short trade. This is also how the Tesla split happened.   Imho, Musk knew there were counterfeit shares of Tesla out there being shorted to take retail money, and must have had proof, because otherwise, when he said he secured funding to go private (and lied), he would have went to jail. Whatever proof he had on the SEC (I suspect he rounded up enough stock holding whales to prove they owned all available stock), was enough for him to scare the bejesus out of those synthetic shorters when he said they secured private funding. If retail could somehow figure out a way to prove we own ALL gme shares (which I know without a doubt we do--this thing has worldwide attention with 50M float shares, really, u don't think 5M people hold on average 10 shares?!), we would win like tesla ive been holding since i entered at 37 $, and i will be holding until i make enough money off GME that lets me retire, buy my lambo and kick my wife’s boyfriend to the curb I’m a one-trick pony. GME or bust. Yeah it’s a distraction. Together strong, divided we fall. GME stronk. 👥⬅️ ❤️ the stock, GME to the 🌔! 🐵 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 💪, together 👥⬅️ ⬆️👤! I will prove you wrong. Soon GME is accepted as currency. If you’re holding GME and a rocket travels at 1000 miles per hour how much is your stock worth at the end of the day? 🚀 I have 500 in GME I'm thinking if I should put more into it for when it opens. Any suggestions? How $131k can take you to $10m? what am I missing?   GME will never be ±$7k per stock if you think you're gonna get to $10M from GME then your an idiot VTEC GONNA TAKE US TO THE MOON AND GME IS OUR FUEL!!!! There is no way anyone would care, unless they got their money in it.   Seen your comments, you don\`t own any. You just comment negative on everything surrounding GME.     You are not giving advices, you are just plain hating.      You are bot or you just have sad life. Either way, I feel sorry for you <3 What’re your thoughts on wheeling GME?   Write OTM puts Expire worthless or get assigned  If assigned, sell CC until shares taken away I do not hold GME have been in and out but do not hold it for more than a couple of days. Here what I did Thursday when it was 170  Scan the calls and found that there was someone willing to pay 20 bucks for a 800 call for March 19 th ( 3 weeks ). After buying the call, as I think we will go back to 30-40 in the next 3 weeks I bought a 60 put for 10 bucks.   On Friday when stock came to 100 the 800 calls drop to 6 bucks, I bought he calls back and close the position but kept my put as they are basically free with the profit from the calls. Someone should make a meme with the other 80's classic campaign ""This is your brain, this is your brain on GME"" I only have 2 measly shares of GME @ over $100 and 20 of AMC at an average of $13. I dont want to buy 200 more of each but.... kinda do.   Please just go ape shit on here and share your honest opinion. I understand that your comments are not financial advice nor do I encourage anyone to use anything you see here as financial advice. I will however read each and every last comment even if I only get one or 2 as expected.   Yours Truly  - Depressed Ape  EDIT - this definitely got more love than I thought it would. I definitely won’t risk my ENTIRE life savings and the reason I say “not financial advice” is cause the SEC is watching and we are all adults that work hard for our money! I know not to risk what can’t be lost and appreciate the sentiment.   Much love to anyone reading and commenting and i’d love to reply to all of you but didn’t think this would get more than 2-3 comments before dying I hold measly 20 shares in GME, yet I don't regret a single buy. I'm a student that made some disposable income over the last 2 years and I've been so depressed there's nothing I want to spend it on, literally I had no urges to take the money and buy something because I was emotionally flatlined to material bullshit. However, this made me feel like I'm a part of something bigger; the memes, the self-depreciating humor of the board, the lingo. It's fucking amazing, I finally feel like I belong somewhere, even if it's fucking degenerately retarded. Even if it all goes to shit, I'm glad I did it.  As for me, I like the subreddit. In my humble opinion only, if GME ever holds a shareholder meeting with its shareholders, it will find that us apes own more stock than registered at the exchange in its entirety (about 70M shares registered, and I guesstimate we already own 200M shares, 130M of which are fraudulent) this fraudulent share bag can only be transferred to other bagholders until it is covered. I am just an ape that will hodl, with a propensity to buy more. Never too late to buy some GME. My advice, just personal not financial because I’m literally retarded, is that it’s not too late for either. Most are in agreement a squeeze is inevitable for GME, they’re just not sure when and how much it’ll rise to.    Maybe give GME some time Monday morning and see if it’s going up or down. If the price is going up buy it. If it seems to be trading down, then wait a bit and buy when it stops or starts going back up. The consensus seems to be a squeeze sooner rather than later.    AMC is not too late either, and it’s so cheap. I bought 50 shares last week, but I’m not nearly excited for that as I am to see what GME does. I think AMC may get to $30 eventually, but who knows when? I am not a financial advisor and have no idea how this will play out. We don’t get to see the whole picture and those greedy HFS are not stupid, just greedy AF.  No idea if it’s too late to join in, but I am thinking this gets sorted out at the close of the first quarter. Currently holding 150 of GME and 500 of AMC. Only risk what you can afford to lose and do whatever is best for you. This sub wants you to succeed. This seems fishy.  You have $500 invested between GME & AMC.  And youre asking if you should throw $20K into them? If im wrong, im sorry.   But i smell something Look, you're gonna get a ton of confirmation bias here telling you this shit is going to the moon. Ignore that.  GME is a fucking roulette wheel at this point. It could easily go back to $30, or maybe it could go to $180 on a crazy spike. Personally, I never thought it was gonna hit $100 ever again, but here we are. The people telling you ""It's guranteed money!"" are idiots.  Be careful. I got rid of AMC, they are knock offs showing no solid resurrection plan. I put $400 in total between $45-$60 on GME as soon as Cohen was in. When the stock goes up I sell a 1/3 then buy more at the dip. I have 16 shares now, should be able to get another 4 Monday if we get a morning jump and dip. Trying to get a bunch before stimulus. If you can't just throw cash down but you feel it's a better gamble than lotto, feel free to make the system work for you and cash high buy low. Maybe it'll never stabilize and you can just cash out a portion for basic living on all the highs. Everyone has their ideas, but until Gamestop has solid evidence they aren't going to go tits up, this stock probably won't spike to the moon because hf don't have to buy back shares. For what they might owe, they can wait and pay interest, not like they pay a lot in interest, but as soon as it's evident this is a money pit for them and they can't win, the stocks could be worth a lot. Do you believe Gamestop will grow, in our recently germaphobic and home isolating society? Where kids are socializing in person less? Even if it doesn't make 5k mark, it's still one of the most productive stocks I have, and intend to use the hf games to my advantage, and buy as many stocks as I can on its own dollar. In a similar boat as you. I’ll be honest I’m buying more GME for sure. Have about 122 shares of AMC and 17 GME. We are in a historic time so I’m going all in on what I can spend, because if I lose the money, yeah that sucks but I’d be kicking myself if I chose to miss out on this potential historic event. Waiting to see how prices fluctuate Monday and I’m going back in for more I would try to average down your AMC. Try to get between $9-$10. I think you can make More money with AMC than GME at this point.  This is not financial advice. You could definitely get into GME, especially if you have Webull premarket trading enabled. As for AMC, I think there’s still time to get in before a gamma squeeze. Hope this helps! I would jump in on AMC. GME has left the launch pad too much risk for to little potential gain I think GME will dip. Waiting for maybe 60 to get back in  That way if it goes to 40 it’ll be easier to average down Sell GME at profit then buy more AMC on the ladder attacks . GME had no reason to blow up like that  again but who knows GME is a freaking anomaly. AMC has solid fundamentals and is in a great position to grow big right now and from a much more broad range of investors  Also a more affordable stock for your budget.  I’m not a finically adviser It’s just my opinion. Do what you want both are risky. I’d say GME is much of a risk . Is GME hitting $200 and then $180 again not the squeeze? It seems reasonable considering short interest is way lower this time. Considering jumping back in after listening to all the bots and shills but idk if people are holding or buying or this still has room to run. Not a financial advice but I would say focus on 1. If GME squeezes then you can buy AMC after if you still believe in it. Even if they both squeezes at the same time, you'll have more profit in GME. Shorts are deeper in GME and has more long term value at play. But you do you. Maybe you can borrow the stock, if it goes up you sell it and keep the profit. Wait for it to go down and return the stock...I think I've seen this strategy somewhere. Jking, if I have free money, I would get on the vix. Last time GME squoze, the vix followed it.   **Not a financial advisor. Sell your AMC👎 and put it all to GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Wrong answer. When its comes to GME you buy high and that's it. No selling. meant shares  EDIT - 200 AMC shares 50ish GME at most GME is distracting AMC. Those bad guys finished $GME $AMC and started to want to work on $CLOV, let us unite and defeat it Hey WSB Don’t forget about your love of SNDL That 4 bagger plus run helped fund your second round of GME and AMC Come back this week to SNDL for another funding Quick 2-4 bagger just waiting to be started Better sell before the squeeze on GME lol all other stocks volume will go hella down Wtf is this? you spelled GME wrong That portfolio sucks.  You got fucked in the ass last week by Tim Cook himself. Had you bought GME last Friday you woulda gone up over 100% Sold 🍎 to buy GME Buuuuutttt....how much GME ya got? There is only one answer as to how on Earth 140% shorting was allowed. This is due to the concept of naked shorting...  this in simple terms is when shorters (like big institutions like Melvin) decide to short the stocks without locating the stock holders (basically meaning they are shorting without caring about if their shorts match the supply of holders) and this lead to 140% shorting which lead to phantom shares. This is all highly illegal except for one exception (to the best of my belief (youtube it and read up on the SEC to confirm otherwise don’t believe me)... an exception to which the government will turn the check is when naked short selling a company that results in bankrupt by which they end up making big amounts of profit.  Why does this even matter? It’s because through these phantom shares, they are able to manipulate the ‘failure to deliver’ system in the stock market and so through manipulating these failure to delivers they trick the algorithm into having to adjust a sell off - they do this to trick us and to make us actually fear and cause a real sell off - they belief this hype is temporary that will pass, they do not realise that we are not cats that are not playing around no more...   Think about it, no honestly think about it...everyone was gunning for $1,000 the way in which we are all diamond handing this hold then why would a natural sell off occur only half way? It’s because of market manipulation caused by the restrictions of being able to buy shares, the news media penetrating that the interest in GME was over and these Failure to deliver and ladder attacks. The Majority of us are still holding, holding through -80% and didn’t sell when it went down why? Well it’s simple. ITS BECAUSE THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT BEEN SQUOZE.   Now back to naked short selling, this is market manipulation at its finest BUT, of course GameStop is no longer dead. Through the great help of Ryhan Cohen’s and WSB the giant has been revived once more meaning that there is inevitable death for the HF’s as long as we manage to hold. Shorting requires for interests to have to be paid in order to keep the position open. Which means that if we hold on long enough we will absorb Melvin dry. The more hype there is the more these interests go up. And that’s our key to pulling off a wicked gamma squeeze like nothing seen before us...it’s a great time to be alive!  And although it may appear on screen that short interest is back under the 100% mark. I think that the final 40% of shorts won’t be able to be deductible since it’s made up of phantom shares. Melvins and all the other hedgefunds only way to succeed was for them to pull this short off in the shadows without anyone realising. This stock has been shorted for years! But that plan has now epically failed so now they know they have no choice but to use any dirty tactics they can to divide and conquer through any and every manipulation tactics that exist. it’s corruption vs the people. Unity will prevail if we stay strong together 💎  Hold my diamond apes our promised day is near 💎🚀📈📈📈📈📈📈📈  *Disclaimer* This is not financial advice, this is merely the thoughts of a smooth brained ape so I honestly don’t want you to believe anything I said. I don’t know what I’m talking about and I’m smoking on crayons as we speak.  The purpose was to point you to the right directions and now I want you to do your own research about naked short selling implications and verify if I am correct. To the best of my ability I do believe what I said is right. But like I said, I’m a smooth brained ape so I could be wrong. There’s really only one way to know and that’s for you to do your own research. Take my thoughts with a pinch of salt! Hold the stock and keeping the price high will give GME the capital they will need to execute the massive pivot that will cause the Shares to naturally raise higher and kill the shorties from another angle! I hope. If all apes buys 10 GME shares each on Monday,  the total will be more than 90 million shares besides public interest to the shares. Let's use the power of numbers to buy the Gamestop we all ♥️ As expected of a 1mon old account, this is complete bs. Sorry to pop your bubble, but it is EXTREMELY UNLIKELY that Melvin will run out of cash to leverage their shorts. You've seen yourself the manipulation; if they hedged every high and low they would never run out of capital, not to mention their sold calls that expired OTM. The squeeze will also never reach a point so as to bankrupt Melvin, because the SEC will step in to prevent a massive degrossings. Plus, Melvin rolled up their shorts to the hundreds, maybe even 400, so if you use the same ratio as before, GME would need to reach >5000$ to make them bankrupt. If it even gets close to that, we'll see the same closings of brokerages, media attacks, etc all enacted by the SEC. Just spent my whole Pay check on more GME before closing.  Ill also bought a case of ramen noodles at Costco.  I will be buying fine tenderloin next month GME stock will become the worlds currency.  Future wars will be fought over it.  And in a the ruins of civilization, apes will rule the planet. I just want to buy enough GME shares that I can buy a space ship and actually go to the moon!! I just know how to eat crayon and buy GME 🦍🤲💎🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🤲💎🤲💎🤲💎🤲💎🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚 Didn’t have much but put all 4000 into GME at 109 , will hold !!! Diamonds to the end https: m.youtube.com/watch?v=uuVgvab1gSg  Solid video on GME analysis I want to short GME, so I borrow a share from the market, and sell it immediately. I owe my broker a share.  You want to short GME, so you borrow a share from the market, and sell it immediately. You owe your broker a share.  Except you borrowed the same share I’d sold back. One share exists, and two are shorted. We now have a short interest ratio of 2.0 without any fictional shares having to be created.  We don’t *need* naked short selling to have a short interest ratio above 1.0, nor do we need it for a short squeeze to exist. It may well have happened here, but the mere existence of a short interest ratio above 1.0 is not evidence. Too long, ‘Directions unclear’... Set buy order for GME on Monday. So, like last time. What has to be done differently to achieve a squeeze or a gamma squeeze?  I heard someone say that we need to hit a certain price target for example 800 dollars.  I know nothing about this ofcourse but I wonder what has to be done exactly for GME to moon unlike last time. I have the feeling that they will add restrictions again to buy GME Aren't Melvin out of GME? I can’t afford to buy into GME, my buddy said he put his cash app on here and y’all helped him buy a few shares, he said it would be worth a shot to throw my cash app on here as well $ArcticIceTPL That's 14 GME shares for each ape provided the share price remains steady for the next month or so. Fair price of GME is $1400 Low key are you taking personal customers? Gunna need someone who knows the GME sitch so I don't have to explain a 200k windfall after this year... Text to speech apps/websites, life changer. Plus hearing a woman give me DD on GME makes me all giggly. I wonder if it’s possible for retail investors to obtain all shares of GME or atleast 75%, how would that influence the price? Would the stock just plummet because nobody is willing to sell, or would the inverse happen? I just wonder why aren’t other savvy traders or investors diving in on this and driving up the price even higher because all these shares will eventually have to be delivered. It seems like us retail folks are the only ones holding shares. Why wouldn’t small cap investors buy up GME for the impending rocket. Thank you. I'm not saying that there isn't to be more money to be made from this (I sure hope so with my 20 GME), but if people think the hedge funds aren't playing both sides of this, they're delusional. I can almost 100% guarantee they shorted this shit at $450. All we can hope is that they didn't learn their lesson and shorted this shit AGAIN, cause I'm sure they have covered a lot of the initial shorts that were of such interest in January. Ahaha that’s how we all feel. But in the end if your bullish on something like a squeeze then even buying as it is, is still very profitable. I’m satisfied with the amount I have in GME but I’m excited as hell to buy more AMC this monday hopefully getting in before the prices boosts cos of the millions of shares market makers are going to have to buy this coming Monday You forget that many institutions hold GME! We hold way more than 5% of all the tradable stocks, at least 10-20%. I’m not sure what you said but Uncle Bruce was explaining that the shorted HF could start buying itm calls and cover and also become long on GME. And that could also run the price up. You know what my dude, I think you’ve just made a sweet amount of unrealised profits. I got news that hundreds of thousands of call options ended in the money on Friday (Tendies for the buyers and huge costs to the sellers) so now these sellers will have to buy all of these hundreds of thousands of call options X 100. So there should be a sweet mini squeeze on the coming Monday, and the pressure just keeps building on from there. Don’t quote me though it’s just my opinion. GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Don’t worry, I didn’t base my information off nothing yk. There was an article that came out about the GME naked short selling positions by hedgefunds. I thought I explained why they would naked short anyway? It’s a dirty tactic they are using to try and manipulate a sell off in the algorithm to incite fear that people are locking in profits and selling. You are right that it may not be exactly 40% since nothing nowadays is ever accurate but you bet your ass it’s somewhere around that level. At least that’s what I think. Like I said these are just my thoughts Okay. First off I highly recommend you do independent research and find out about squeezes. Trey trades is a good YouTuber who finely explains it. But to put it into simple terms. A gamma squeeze occurs when there is a strong short interest in a stock (like AMC and GME) then there are hundreds of thousands of option calls on these stock (option call = you by a contract fire 100 shares and it’s just like a betting store you bet that the valuation will be $XXXX. To be profitable you need the valuations I go above that strike price you chose) when this happens. You are making profit and so now the market makers have to go and buy 100 shares for every contract buyers own. Since the price is above the valuation price, the market makers lose money as they now have to buy those shares at a higher price. Whereas they make money by the price going lower than the target price. This is basically what happened last Friday. Majority of the calls in AMC were $8. And we passed that. So now market makers have to buy 100 shares...and there are hundreds of thousands of these contracts. So you can imagine the ridiculous buying force on Monday when they have to buy. This causes a gamma squeeze and as supply of the shares are down (since we are already holding them) the demand increases and so the market price gets higher and higher. The hedgefunds on the other hand. They are buying puts and shorts. And since now the buyers are profitable, the sellers are severely unprofitable and so once all their cash has run out or they decide they’ve had enough. They too will close their positions by buying 100 shares per contract. So now you can see this vigorous cycles of increasing demand and no decrease is supply. And this what basically causes the gamma short squeeze to occur. The buyers force the sellers to close their positions through running their cash dry since they have to pay interest every day to keep their positions open which the interest keeps going higher as the buying power increases and also make the market makers have to buy all of these shares on the buyers behalf. Hope that helped No no no don’t say that. By saying that you can have law suits up your ass from anyone who listened to you meaning that your basically making a risk free play for people as if they lose money they will sue you and get that money back no harm done! Unless you really have diamond balls and are an actual financial advisor then go for it. GME and AMC to the MOON regardless🚀🚀 My tax return went straight into GME. I was just going to piss it away on something stupid anyways and so far this is more fun than pizza and bar tabs. Lmao what? That would put GME at a 7 trillion dollar market cap Of course!  I get all my financial advice from my cat.  Meow = buy more GME Remember it is unrealized profits - they need to buy back their short shares at a rock bottom price or bankrupt GME to realize these profits.  If I keep holding and don't sell their loss just goes up. Exactly! If HF's are making so much on both sides of this thing GME would be trading a lot more sporadic and more frequently. The Vol and price action both suggest that someone is trying throw a burlap sack on a gas fire. Not someone is riding up and then riding it down. If it was a 1x scenario in Jan I would agree, too much of a coincidence too happen two times, when GME spikes. Looks  likes causation to me. But hey I'm just an ape who uses crayons to make graphs. Not sure how you arrived at that conclusion. I only stated that Biden has ""just"" taken office. There is no way his team will let the market go belly up and have GME define his presidency. It won't happen. It's not about WHO the current president is but rather the overall climate of the country. Please enlighten me on what the worst situation is? What $200, $300 a share? You're out of your mind if you think this is going to sub $50 anytime soon.  Ape's WILL GET PAID AND LAND ON MOON.. Chicago and The Street will probably get bailed out and the wheels keep on turning. James Simmons the math professor I think from NYU? . Dalio is pretty well-known I’ll give you that. Maybe I misunderstood ur comment. Citadel and Bridgewater definitely have more publicly available information on them but I’d be hard pressed to find someone who’s heard of citadel, TwoSigma or DE Shaw but not RenTec (at least prior to GME). Like you said they’re pretty much the OG quant fund Okay so you’re long?  Please refer to my other comment.  $400 15 years from now is the best.  THE BEST.  GME can do. I don't believe that to be remotely true but even if it was. I would happily park a few thousand in GME for that return. You haven't done your due diligence. You obviously don't know RC's track record, You're obviously not aware of the cash they have on hand. Even if we're looking at the squeeze, all your skepticim comes from the government stepping and screwing retail bailing out short and long HF's. You sound nuts with nothing to substantiate your statements. What brokerage do you use? Nothing in the market is guaranteed. Every GME thread on WSB has multiple Apes telling other Ape's only invest what you can afford to lose so stop it. You haven't done your DD so why would anyone take your advice? If #GME hits 800 I’m having a giant blue diamond tattoos on and around my asshole! Is there actually a posdible way for it to ho to $800 a share? Sounds like from what I have been reading the hedge funds are running out of cash so does that mean the price of GME won't be going down much further than $90 a share? GME rocket on my back to remind me who took me to the moon Monday Mania AMC and GME let’s gooooo.  This the first weekend I’m like who invited these Lol isn't there some dumbass model that says, GME will hit $130K? When GME reach even 300? a rocket with GME  going up Vlad's asshole.  at least 8 inches in size. Should just get a 100 dollar bill tatted on his PP so he can see his money grow like GME🍻💸📈 I meant if GME hits $800. I would’ve used the gains to pay for it lol  But since my wording was poor I will still get a tattoo if the upvote count hits 800. I feel obligated. You gotta diversify your bonds n\*\*\*\*!!!!  GME, GME, GME, GME, a little AMC, maybe some BB LEAPS, and more GME! I heard on CNN he said NWPN was the next GME. BB and AMC aren’t doing shit because all anyone cares about is GME. I can understand the GME squeeze and hope, but I don’t understand the BB one. It has never spiked anywhere near what GME has. Can someone ELI5? That isn't the intent of WSB. Get some questionable DD, laugh at retards who lost their kids college fund, watch some degenerate drink piss out of a martini glass, that is WSB. ""We"" doesn't exist in the sense you are using it. And from what I've heard from this sub lately, most GME holders don't have an exit strategy anyways, so those tendies are pixels on your screen, nothing more. All that aside, wouldn't you like to position yourself before the hordes of retards pile back into BB? Get in now, if you don't have capital for it then go give handjobs behind your local AMC theater, I think most of them are still closed anyways. This is a bad strategy. You people shouldn't have FOMO'd to begin with...but since you are short bus apes and did, there isn't much to be done about that.  Take your loss and put it into a stock that can actually rocket...   You really want to miss out on a year or two of possible gains because you think BB might eventually recover?  EDIT: fuck it, stay broke. Your loss porn is fun to laugh at.   You guys must be salty that you missed out on GME, TWICE  It is so fun arguing with all these BRAND NEW ACCOUNTS, or accounts that have been dormant for years. What a bunch of shills. Be careful people...some true pumpers out here GME - March 5th $420 Calls - 💎🤚'ing This Shit Till 🍗's or Broke Well you'll find out soon.  I think you need to starting hoping that the US stimulus money gets distributed by then and GME still has lots of hype going for it. bro, how about you set a GME@10k call till march 25th? On Friday GME performance was very bad $31k on $420 calls in early March. Completely dumbfounding to me. I want GME to rocket, but I'm not betting $30+k on them heading to $420+ rapidly. If these options expire ITM, I'll eat a sandwich consisting of bread, mayo, and my hair.  Edit: It's OP's own money - if he wanted to buy, say, $800 calls expiring a day later, so be it/no judgement. Just not something I would personally do, even at $420 a week or so out Thank you for your blessings. May GME be with you 🚀🌕 Then he goes down in history as the greatest retard in history when GME hits $1k on March 12th. That only happens if the price of shares goes up.  Calls but themselves don't do that.  If we all bought calls instead of shares, the price of GME would have never gone up.  You can buy all the $420 calls you want, but if the shares price doesn't go up to $420+, the writers of those calls just collect free money.  Simple as that. And believe me, they're loving the free money. We're more or less in the same boat. I made a disastrous mistake by not averaging down when GME hit the 40's. Granted I feared that it would sink even deeper hence not moving forward. In any event, I averaged down from 247 to 187 last week which didn't really help as the highest we hit was 170. At this point just trying to clean up this big mess I made.  Thank God I won't starve or lose my house if I lose all 2500 I have invested however it just sucks because in January I anticipated walking away with SOMETHING...not a negative portfolio. That's why I'm not trying to be greedy anymore...merely hoping to get my account back into shape and buy back in less retardedly Dude where have you been this past week? GME is already surging haha. Correct. Yes. He put pressure on one of the last squeezes. All I mean is GME needs more of this, but the expiration of this won’t necessarily move the needle Thank you. May GME be with you 🙏 It's not GME type gains but still works.............. GME Shares, LEAPS, FDs It’s a small small small percentage of my net worth.  I’ll going to deploy another $100,000 on GME on dips and pullbacks By the looks of losses maybe a hedge fund shorting GME? New Video from Bruce Frommert describes what he thinks is going on in GME. Worth a watch. tldr in post. &#x200B;  Hello beautiful apes.  For those of you so smooth-brained that you've not heard of Uncle Bruce, then allow me to use my tastiest crayon to enlighten you. Stock Markets with Bruce has been a stalwart of the GME saga and the old silverback has been live streaming throughout the whole damn thing. The guy deserves all the support and praise you can give him.  Onto his DD, go to the youtube channel 'Stock Markets With Bruce' and view the video 'GameStop GME Uncle Bruce Says I think I Know Whats Going On! Stock Markets In Plain English'. I can't link it sadly.  **tldr**; Hedgefunds with short positions are buying 2x(numOfShorts) call options deep in the money to not only cover their short positions, but then end up long GME. There are more calls available than tradable stock (due to naked call contracts) and thus they can then join-in the diamond hand rocket while the Chicago Market Makers (options writers) have to scramble around trying to buy more stock than exists. All this while the newly longed HF's slowly leak shares to the MM's at ever increasing prices.  Does this mean the shorts are now coming in to bat for us? I'm more than happy for smart money to yeet this thing to the moon, I'm here for tendies, nothing more, nothing less.  If I've wrongly interpreted the DD and you've been triggered, first well done for watching Bruce's video, give him a thumbs up while you're there. Second, don't get angry at me, hate yourself for taking financial advice from an ape on the internet. P.S. If you are my wife's BF then I'm sorry... I don't know what for, I just am.  My position: long 11.57 GME @ $105  Credit goes to Bruce Frommert, of Stock Markets With Bruce. If you feel enlightened and want to share some love, please direct it at him!  Edit: obligatory rockets 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  **tldr for the tldr**: This thing is now decided by the options market. Hodl  &#x200B;  **Edit**: This post blew up more than I expected. Thanks for the kind words and support! I've never received rewards before for a post so feel very humbled. Please credit Bruce before me though, I'm just the retarded ape messenger 😀 Would this all end if GME issues additional shares? That's my main concern because it seems if a substantial amount of new shares are issued, this whole squeeze will fall apart. I'm sure the MMs or any big player who stands to lose in a MOASS will put significant pressure on GME's board/executives to force them to issue new shares. If true this changes things.  If HF are making money this way, the losers will be MM who can't buy shares fast enough to hedge without the share price going up. Money transfer from MM to HF.  MM will have to change the way they sell options or stop offering them entirely for stonks like GME with high options volume and relatively low float plus too many 💎✋ keeping shares locked up. They are just too vulnerable to losses otherwise. I expect options liquidity to go way down, IV up, or the bid/ask to go up. Maybe this all already happened.  When HF close their calls, MM will dump shares they were using to hedge, dropping the share price. I expect HF to close their calls as soon as they have finished loading up their shorts. Watch for the price to drop after the shares available to short drops to 0, which is just when all of us apes are expecting MOASS.   Risky risky. If strong apes together buy more than the MM dump we will really get the MOASS and HF will get squeezed on the shorts. 11.57 GME @ $105 Long  Prob purchased this week, you truly belong here 130 shares at average of $72... Going shopping again Monday opening bell. I have a hunch the Heggies will hammer GME and drop the price (for a while anyway) ,, might be a good time to pick up a few more shares It is better to buy ITM call options on GME at this point? So pretty much if this is true it's time to day trade GME. Every day. All day. Yeah I can do that. adding my 2 cents, when GME crashed to $40 Bruce said the squeeze was over and that Gamestop would be a good business still. and now he is hyping GME again, fuck him. As I understand it:  If the call option is in the money - Even if the holder of the call option cannot afford to exercise the call option, when they close their position and sell their option contract, the buyer of the call option might.  if you're a big HF, and you buy up quantity 1000 $100 call options on Friday, exercise and sell, that's 100,000 stocks worth $1.74 profit/share or an easy $174,000, all through passing the buck onto the MM.  The frenzy by MM to buy stock might drive the price up, in which case they can either sell for more profit, or go long for when GME is a reinvested company with great revenues and a stock worth $300-$400+ legit.  I understand that the price to buy the call contract plays a part, but I was corrected elsewhere that it doesn't once the call contract is sold from its buyer.  If the contract just expires thereafter, poof.  Nothing happens, the MM and broker made their money in fees. Edit, I've been corrected on this last sentence.   All options itm will be exercised by someone. Because that's how it always happens. They write many contracts and adjust their risk position as the stock changes.     BUT when it appreciates in ways that no one expected, so as the share price rises and becomes more likely that certain written calls are ITM, then these market makers will rush out to buy the stock so if they end up ITM they can cover. This is really why you can see the gamma squeeze.     In the case of GME it all comes back to the float. Because there are so few actual shares going around when it becomes time for them to go to market to get the shares they might have a lot of trouble locating any- driving the price up big time. This is the theory... Larger floats like AMC won't have a share shortage but you may still see a good old squeeze or a bit of a gamma BUT shorters don't have to cover unless they're margin called- and that doesn't really happen, they can just get more money or sell down long positions. So.... The only real squeeze is a long-term one, when the company actually is doing better and not likely to go bankrupt. TSLA great example. People shorted that for years. Most retails have no patience. Dudes crowdfunding because he's smart. He is clearly not anywhere near broke - but his usual source of  (probably extra, since he's undoubtedly retired) income is his other channel, Travelling with Bruce, and obviously he can't travel right now. He has patreon subscribers and donations from them that keep him pretty well off. He was in the stock market for something like 40 years, so he has plenty of knowledge, and saw the opportunity for more cash flow with this channel, and took it.   He's not raising money for a Tesla because he's broke, they call it the Tesla fund because that's what the fans decided it was, and he doesn't have a Tesla because he is smart with his money. Him and his wife don't buy something until they have twice as much money as something costs - that's how they made it to where they are in the first place.   He reads off the comments because they are hilarious, but also because they have some really good questions, usually from beginner traders, and is able to provide really well thought out yet simple enough to understand replies. Sometimes he just reads of random comments, sometimes he looks for questions, and sometimes he just ignores the chat altogether. It's his personality. He's very much a boomer and doesn't understand many jokes, which makes it all the more entertaining.  He's a funny, smart, and genuine guy. He doesn't try to trick people into donating, he's completely clear about why it is that he's here. He's your favourite uncle bruce! Love that dude. Not here to convince you otherwise, just to clear it up for those who are interested in watching.  Edit: also, the dude was talking about GME on his channel in Dec. He didn't just jump on the hype on Jan 25th, he just starting live streaming more frequently when people started coming to his channel just for GME news. He has always liked GME for fundamentals and not for the squeeze. Nothing has changed there. If this was before the move up then they have entered a back spread and it would imply the hedge funds are EXTREMELY bullish on the stock. In other words, literally everyone in the world including Melvin and Citadel thinks GME will go to the moon and the price action in the past month is a bunch of none sense.  Hope you realise how ridiculous it sounds.   More likely case is that youtube dude didn’t know that “hedge funds” don’t actually hedge their bets. I think this is pretty accurate....and let's not forget about the Titans in the room and their part as well: Blackrock, Fidelity, and Vanguard.  At some point, if it hasn't happened already - they are going to get tired of the shorting/naked calling HF's upsetting the greater market with everything surrounding GME and position themselves to put an end to it by triggering the MOASS.   If I were with one of those other firms, and if any of the DD orbiting around GME is accurate, if a MOASS is inevitable - I would want it in the rear-view mirror sooner than later. The sooner it is just fucking done with, the sooner we can react, adjust, recover, and get back to business as normal. I would think that even for people who do this stuff all day long, that GME has to be exhausting and disproportionately time-consuming. Yes you are right! But last week, they also hoped for decreased price but it closed over 100 and the OI in ITM calls ended significantly higher than the OI in ITM puts  They always had plans for the GME price to decrease and that s why they lost this one and maybe the next one Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰  Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:  When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.  RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself).   $RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back.   It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT.   BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?  GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you.   The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.  Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November.   Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.  BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:  Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?    TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌   Edit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40. To those who have family members who are special needs, I apologize - I am merely speaking the language of my targeted audience (WSB)  Positions: https: imgur.com/a/DbOCCYG (PTON is another story for another time) **NOTE:** I also have another 60k of RKT in my Roth.   ALSO THIS POST IS NOT A DD. To read my DDs on RKT click below (three DDs in one):  https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf You fucking retards thinking GME is the only play in the stock market is becoming increasingly more frustrating.   I was hesitant on RKT, I even commented earlier this month describing my concerns regarding the potential negatives in the housing market. Sometimes it’s important to see things from both sides of the coin, and my bearish mentality was squashed after RKT’s recent earnings report.   There is no doubt to where RKT is heading. Here’s what I would suggest:  - roll your options from short term to leaps, even if that reduces your lotto positions. - keep adding shares under $25, it’s a no brainer. - stop worrying about informing retail on it’s benefits. They play such a small roll in it.   GME has stolen the show (I’ve got various positions in it), and there seriously is a weird mentality on WSB. It really won’t last forever and will cycle, just like mid-February.   Use this time to increase your RKT positions, especially while institutional investors increase their holdings (this is guaranteed).   RKT is a home run, potentially a grand slam. 10 baggers like this one don’t need viral assistance, in fact, it probably does it a disservice.   TLDR; I don’t just like this stock, I love this stock. Love it! I was banned too for trying to just spread the word of this fantastic company and how it’s set up as a recipe for one fucking hell of a squeeze. Unlike GME, this is actually a very undervalued, strong company. Their earnings just proved this. Never selling this company. Only buying more I got spanked pretty hard buying GME out of the emotion of sticking it to the hedgies. This time I actually see long term sustainable value in RKT's coming squeeze. The squeeze id just icing on the rocket shaped cake for me. I bought my first ever calls before market close, I for sure think its set to pop in a big way.  What my fellow apes fail to recognize is for all the fun we're having losing money in GME, the company itself isn't doing a god damned thing to help the squeeze. RKT is actively setting the stage, offering a dividend incentive to do it, and planning to buy back float to increase the scarcity for shorts to buy back once they want out.   If you want to stick it to hedgies and don't give two shits about the long term of RKT, then at least collect $1.11 per share of literally free fucking money while shares are cheap then sell once you collect late March. OP left out a buncha things. I think he ran out of crayons:   * The $1.11 special dividend is screwing  the shorts. If they own the stock til the dividend date, they have to pay the dividend to the folks they borrowed from. * RKT doesn't need the fucking money. They're profitable as fuck. They only did an IPO to allow insiders to have liquidity and/or acquire other companies. * Nearly all the time when a company is shorted, they expect it to lose money, or it's overpriced. Like I said, they don't need the money. However RKT did just have a huge 3rd quarter (and 2020) due to refinancings, so next year won't be as profitable. But they're still growing fast. * The lockup period for insiders to sell their stock came and went. No one sold, they know the stock is worth more.  * Main risk for a mortgage company is rising interest rates. The fed has said they'll [maintain the low rates until 2022](https: www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/fed-meeting-decision-interest-rates.html) * Because of the buyback program, the stock can't go down much. If it does, they'll BUY IT BACK. Stupid shorts, how are you going to make money if it the company will prevent it from going lower?  I personally think the special dividend was a FU to the shorts, and they'll start their buyback leading up to the dividend as a FU twice. So unlike GME we aren't relying on paper hands to squeeze the squoze. There's a billion dollars of squeezy-squeezy coming. We just don't know if it'll squeeze quick or slow.  Even if nothing happens, the likelihood of the stock going down is as small as your pecker in freezing ice cold water in the middle of winter. If you're going to try f'ing the big shorts, don't you want to practice safe sex?  I also like the stock. Will be holding long term anyway. They have really aggressive expansion plans which will pay off for years. With the advent of attacking systemic short sellers... it sounds like the people are rising up against the mob to stop the mob from crashing the economy.  Im ok with this.  Not ditching GME though, nerd. Sir this is an AMC/GME dispensary Had racked up almost 10k shares in the $20 range and with the price action not doing jack before the earnings coming out Thursday bought a few dozen calls in the $22-25 region.   Wish I had bought more shares, but if it doesn’t move in the next week much I’ll just pile in some more.  Between making bank on GME, AMC, and MP I’m sitting pretty flush and have been trying to say on here for others to get into RKT... but so many are just like “rates are going up, it’s only a mortgage company, etc”  Laughing my ass off while the FANG and ARK crowd get pummeled Most of the accounts with positive comments for this are 2-5 months old.. Some are a little older but with blank profiles that began posting a few weeks ago... Uhm.... Uhm.... I guess I'll just buy more GME$$$ > WHAAA STOP BUY GME U TARDS.... look here, look at RKT, it's literally a rocket to the moon hahahaha go buy that instead Ain't about GME? I'll skip. Get the fuck out of here  It’s GME time u sick fuck🚀🚀🚀 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha what he say? Thanks for this free and most valuable useless info! If you’re so concerned where I spend my cash, can you help out with a loan? Ha ha ha ha ha hold.... hold.... hold...  HOLD GME🖕🏼 Only reason why they did a dividend is to hype themselves up so they can dilute later to pay their ridiculous debt. GME doesn’t do a dividend because their balance sheet is solid. Plus, stocks with dividends are essentially twice taxed. Were you here when it IPOd? Replace GME of today with RKT of then and that's what this board looked like. Not saying there isnt some truth to this but marketbeat's numbers (like many sites) werent reliable like many sites during the initial GME insanity. I always feel like there’s a shit ton of GME bag holders posting shit like your comment trying to recapture the magic and get out of the red. If you're not a TOTAL retard you'll capture those GME gains while you can and get in to something UNDER valued. The GME ride is winding down. Look at the graphs. It's the same pattern as last time. Do you really think those in power are going to let the entire market crash? During their first month in office? They'll manipulate it again same as last time, slowly stepping it down and down. If you don't see that, well, I can't help ya. As for me, already got puts. When GME has returned to a reasonable $30-50 we'll be sure to compare notes. Enjoy u/DeepFuckingValue $GME account balance - manually input from his updates, minus a few dates for better clarity If GME hits $1000 I’ll tattoo these lines on my left ass check He had several options expire worthless. It's a lot of content to watch, but his youtube channel goes pretty in depth to how he executed his long term GME play. It's ""dry"" to a lot of people, but that's probably why nobody was aware of it until now. I’m buying one of the safest stocks on the market: GME. It’s a leading VIX indicator causing the most pressure on the market, and it’s inflating... It’s going up. It’s not going down. I don’t know how fast it’s going up, but everyone can see it happening, right? You folks do have eyes?   I’m up, I’ve taken a little profit from this 🍋and now I’m squeezing. And them I eat it like your moms pussy. Go eat your tendies and play your roblox. If I catch you jerkin off to anime again imma use a belt on your ass.   And when I’m done fucking your mom, I’m squeezing this lemon and the rest of these lemons into one giant diamond under the gigaton nuclear blast of GameStop.   Can’t stop. Won’t stop. GameStonk makes my eggplant go brrr. I’m picky and I don’t like to eat crayons I like to eat paste and cardboard. 🍦 Market go down, GME go up🚀 You know what to do 💎🤲 Can/will it operate separately from GME? AMC is related to GME.   If GME moons  AMC Moons as well Sounded like, ""I have a buttload of worthless AMC that I can't give away, please buy it so it can get to 30$ and I can break even. "" GME, buy and hodl... Now I see why AMC is a strong buy and hold. Retards, every dollar that you put in AMC is a dollar taken away from GME, or it was, when it needed it the most. Why do you push these crap stocks without a story. It broke away from $GME on Friday, when the price stayed above 8. Sad when you have to troll another post to try and save your own position.  Smells like fear.  No one's trying to keep your GME shares down.  It's like being mad at someone donating to a different cancer research than you.  Grow up. Why not invest in both, dumbass? Maximize your profits, likelihood is one will be more profitable than the other. I have AMC and GME, i’ve had AMC since the GME boom, i’ve thrown chunks of my paychecks at it. AMC is worth investing in even in the long term when they announced that they will be remaining open and keeping their employees on, that was the signal for me. Even if this doesn’t happen anytime soon, it will when things start to reopen normally again and life goes back to normal. Cancer research??? Is that your take on AMC, we're donating to different cancer research?? I'm all grown up, toolbag, and I don't have a GME position. I've cashed out. I was only commenting, not trolling, because it's clear to see the panic in the post. Please guys, buy AMC, I'm going broke here!!! Tell you what. I'm sure you can get a message to me in some platform. If AMC ever, EVER, gets to fifteen dollars again, EVER, you send me a message somehow and I'll reimburse the 1k or the 5k it whatever your parents lent you and you blew. Fair enough?? Okay then, have a great night! Because you maximise profits by doing research and identifying clear risks in each stock.  You literally said logically equivalent to: ""why not just buy **every stock**.""  You know why. Because some go down.  AMC may have some activity over this month, but it has no-way the same situation as GME and most definitely does not have good fundamentals supporting the business. I meant they downvoted you...  And no dude, GME is the sole target idk what the hell ur waffling about now Same. This weekend has me nervous. Sentiment seems pretty bearish and I'm figuring if GME BLOWS TF UP then the blue chips will continue their downward trend and these will print, and I won't have to pay some obnoxious premium to make money off it. Spy chart looks ripe for a bounce though so you'll prolly be good man! $305k gain from GME options alone this past 1.5 months, mostly from selling puts. #thetagang4life True, but when GME rocketed to 100 and IV was 800%, it was a no brainer to sell 30-50p AMC AND GME MERGER! One stock to rule them all ! I set a $ 1,000,000 sell limit on each of my GME shares. They can’t sell what is pending. Are the GME shares on robinhood unsqueezable because they can be lent out to shorters by default?  If robinhood is in the pocket of the shorters, they would likley give lenient interest rates on those loans, right? So... explain to me again, why is that bad? Example: broker lends out your 100 shares to hedge funds to short sell, the price gets driven down, and then you purchase another couple shares on the dip. Now you own 103 shares, and the short interest increases, thus making it easier to squeeze the price up. So what if you aren’t getting paid the fees, if it makes it easier to go to the moon? I would advocate for more people to openly offer up their shares to be shorted. That way the dip would be lower, giving you a better entry point, and as long as you aren’t being a paper hand bitch, it makes it much much easier to squeeze these dickheads out of business and take the share price to the moon. The brokers too. They know that they have to cover to costs if the short seller goes bankrupt. I wouldn’t be surprised if the fees associated with borrowing GME are ridiculously high right now because of this. I totally fucked up and my AMC and GME are still on robinhood, what would people recommend doing? I just made a webull account but I’m fucking terrified of my stocks tied up in transferring for 6-10 days. Ugh I have no fucking idea what this post means. But it feels important. I use Robinhood. I tried fidelity and other brokerages but didn't like it. Robinhood  has the  best UI.  I went back to scummy robinhood. And If someone could explain what OP means that would be cool.  BTW I'm not borrowing money from robinhood to buy more GME. Am I safe as long as I don't borrow money?  Edit 2. I sold all my GME to buy more AMC then I tried to sell AMC at a profit to buy more GME. But fucking day trading protection stopped me and now I have 0.7 shares of GME in total. Fucking hate my life Make sure to transfer all your cash to your bank account first.  They will lock your RH account and you will be unable to transfer funds or buy more GME until the transfer is complete. Takes 7+ days Or you can keep a robinhood account without margin and srick it to then when GME moon shots and you pull all your tendies off their brokerage.  If y'all want to collapse robinhood, make them cash in your tendies on gamestop when it hits the moon with a base account you give them no money for. 🤷‍♂️ I bought GME call options on RH but I usually use Schwab. I just used RH cuz I already had options trading on it and I couldn't wait for the application process on Schwab to end. So I'm a retard but not because of the broker I'm using. Think I should transfer Monday morning? I have a TD account that I’ve already transferred to but left a few stocks like GME in my RH account. Looking back at what you EuroKINGS did for GME last time (see Jan 22 - 26), I hope you understand how important and impactful you can be. Bury the US hedgies while they sleep, mon ami. Lol. I see GME in the space And when an stock is halted, It takes Etoro like 1 extra minute to come back, so I the stock gets halted from dropping like GME the first time it went to 144 on january and started falling, got halted, and came back to 120, but on etoro was still halted, then halted again, and when it was unhalted went to 90, and Etoro didn´t unhalted it, so you got the full ride from 144 to around 70 without the possibility to get your money out Vi er alle i samme GME båd uanset om dansk, amerikansk eller japansk  😅    .　　　　　　　　　　 ✦ 　　　　   　  　　　˚　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\*　　　　　　   　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　. 　　 　　　　　　　 ✦  　　　　　　　　　　 　 ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ 　　　　 　　　　　　　　　　　　,　　   　  .　　　　　　　　　　　　　.　　　ﾟ　  　　　.　　　　　　　　　　　　　.  ,　　　　　　　.　　　　　　    　　　　  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ☀️  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　    　      　　　　　        　　　　　　　　　　　　　.  　　　　　　　　　　.　　　　　　　　　　　　　. 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　       　   　　　　  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　       　   　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　       　    ✦  　   　　　,　　　　　　　　　　　    🚀 　　　　 　　,　　　 ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ 　 　　　　　　　　　　　　.　　　　　 　　  　　　.　　　　　　　　　　　　　 　           　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　˚　　　 　    　　　　,　　　　　　　　　　　       　    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　.　　　   　　    　　　　　 　　　　　.　　　　　　　　　　　　　.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\* 　　   　　　　　 ✦  　　　　　　　         　        　　　　  　　 　　　　　　　 　　　　　.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　.　　　　　    　　. 　 　　　　　.　　　　 🌑  　　　　　   　　　　　.　　　　　　　　　　　.　　　　　　　　　　   　  ˚　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　ﾟ　　　　　.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　.  　　 　 🌎 ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ,　 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\*  .　　　　　 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　.　　　　　　　　　　 ✦ 　　　　   　 　　　˚　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\*　　　　　　    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　. Bye bye money. GME back to $50 by 3/5 - 3/12. 4/16 GME $420 call... sooo close to 1420.69% Gains ... still holding. $420 calls literally can’t go tits up, right? It's a call contract, so if the price goes over $420 he'd be able to buy stock at below market price (in the money, ITM). The market value is going up because the position's likelyhood of being ITM is causing it's price to be $1600 more than when bought.  Options are also priced against IV (implied volatility) which by going up is driving the options value. Basically that $420 before April was really unlikely, but last week's volatility means it's more likely than initially priced in.  I'm just a retard who buys GME for shits and gigs, so disregard this. Some big brain will hopefully correct where I'm wrong. You think GME has potential to hit 200+ this upcoming week? I'm at 187/share and my portfolio is getting pegged. I averaged down at a terrible time so I'm trying to figure out a safe way to at least break even. Options are like hot potato. If my contract was statistically very unlikely to go ITM.... back when we were around $40... then GME rockets to $200 that Conract premium goes way up... and I can resell it to someone else at a higher price instead of holding to expiry.  Learn your greeks. Vega (Implied Volatility - IV) can make or break you. GME Apollo 10 vs GME Apollo 11 I will start by stating that my retard to autist ratio is 420:69 so take anything with a grain of crayon shavings washed down with Capri-Sun.  We could be in for an interesting week ahead of us. There is already plenty of DD about GME and I would much rather look at some numbers than someone trying to decode tweets by DFV or try and figure out what the Hedgies are up to. I was much more interested in the volume that we have seen the last week and decided to present to you volume from 1/20-1/27 and volume from 2/23-2/26.   &#x200B;  |Date|Open|Close|Volume| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Wednesday 1/20|37.37|39.12|33,471,790| |Thursday 1/21|39.23|43.03|57,079,750| |Friday 1/22|43.59|65.01|197,157,900| |Monday 1/25|96.73|76.79|177,847,000| |Tuesday 1/26|88.56|147.98|178,588,000| |Wednesday 1/27|354.83|347.51|93,396,670|  &#x200B;  |Date|Open|Close|Volume| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Tuesday 2/23|44.97|44.97|7,565,215| |Wednesday 2/24|44.70|91.71|83,111,740| |Thursday 2/25|169.56|108.73|150,308,800| |Friday 2/26|117.46|101.74|92,194,150| |Monday 3/01|TBD|TBD|TBD| |Tuesday 3/02|TBD|TBD|TBD|  &#x200B;  This Does not mean that the upcoming price will skyrocket like it did in January.

To any journalists/reporters that reads these threads and wants to claim that this price movement is due to a bunch of retail investors I would like to respond with a healthy FUCK YOU and that you should know better that the amount of volume that is happening is not because of the retards here.   Data pulled from:  [GameStop Corporation Common Stock (GME) Historical Data | Nasdaq](https: www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical) If my GME holding is worth less this time next week, I will have succeeded in not paper handing.  We're going to the moon or we're going to zero. That is the way. That is the best part of all. If you are like me and are happy holding GME long term, then the squeeze is just a beautiful bonus game snuck into an already epic long game. LOVE THIS STOCK Um, what? Volume went from 7 million on 1/12 to 144 million on 1/13. And implied volatility went from about 80% to about 800%. Maybe this was before you got in, but the week of 1/13 was almost identical to this week. The low on Friday even happened during the same hour of the day as it did on Friday 1/15. If the pattern repeats, GME will be rangebound until next Friday, then start to increase (on Friday) and then moon the week after that. And if the magnitude scales, $1,000 will look like child's play. Fucking retard. All ins are to GME. I don’t think this is coming back, this ain’t GME ape 🦍 but I pray for 🚀🚀🚀 I got a GME position too.. it’s just not as entertaining to look at as this one. That's some interesting roll play.   Have you done your DD on GME?   If you did that you'd know why Oil stocks are bad.

I’m all for 100k but greed isn’t just a hedge problem. This is the most significant event I’ve witnessed. I thought corona was nuts and game changing. The corruption is OBVIOUS and LAUGHABLE. The social activity on here has drastically changed since last month. Every facet of social media is being bombarded from this. They track you and your cookies,they know who you are, they are trying to learn and manipulate your actions. Full social engineering is happening. We are holding strong, been buying every dip 🙌💎 We are ironclad gentleman, 🦍💪🏻👨‍👨‍👦‍👦  $GME  2 @ 280 - Jan 27th 4 @ 45  - Feb 17th 1 @ 108 - Feb 25th I took a time out from eating crayons and watching my wife’s boyfriend work his magic because my smooth brain thinks that AMC and GME just happen to be in some many of the same funds. Right? And all of those commercial real estate funds got hammered by Covid and then targeted by those bloodsucking short sellers. No surprise to me they have similar patterns but I suspect the biggest shot we have is with GME. I think that 🚀 has more fuel than AMC I loved how just last week (before the spike of course), we had some members of the WSB community making fun of $GME ""bagholders"" and telling us to ""let it go already"".  Well....IF YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE FOLKS FUCK YOU BECAUSE $GME & $AMC HODLERS ARE ON A ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON AND YOU'RE NOT INVITED SO GO SHILL SOMEWHERE ELSE. I got lucky with AMC, I bought 800 shares at $2.19 in hopes it might go to $4+... didn’t have a clue about WSB’s, short squeeze etc. Basically putting my profits from AMC into GME. We can speculate all day long about short interest, naked shorts, etc. nobody really knows for sure. I just know the guy that saw this coming last year is still in, and doubled down. To each their own, but that’s enough of a reason for me to see this thing through...  Not financial advice... I have an irl buddy, who has *puts* on GME.... at *50* and I fear for his well being. If he dies, he dies. See you in tendieland my dude. So, you think the SEC would just sit back and let GME collapse the entire US stock market ? Its not gonna happen. GME will be at 50 by the end of the week. Smart people already took the money and ran. More will start cutting losses on Monday. Whats left will be bagholders part 2. Should have learned your lesson the 1st time. I’ve found plenty of DD on why GME is prime for take off, but no one can provide me with actual information on AMC, everywhere I look, as far as I can tell, anyone in AMC is just getting played.  I would love to be proved wrong, but options volume isn’t there. Short volume isn’t there, they aren’t changing their business model.   Give me an actual reason to like AMC. It’s a complete distraction to force money elsewhere so the hedgies have a better chance to short GME This dumb ape's take: AMC is getting a crazy halo effect from being (rightly or wrongly) ""the other GME."" See how many people have been pointing out that their charts have been very similar. If you're bullish on GME, and think the squeeze is yet to be squoze, then I think it's reasonable to plan to dump your AMC at the same time you finally sell your GME, since they should both be as high as they're going to get.   I am dumb. Please do not take my insane ravings as anything more than the babbling of a lunatic. Do not make financial decisions based on anything I say. AMC is not shorted so no movement there.  When the theatres re-open then there will be significant movement.  Buy low and wait it is coming.  I am all in on GME though if that goes that's where the $ are but losses will be the same.  Not that it matters cause I'm not selling!!!! Why is it so hard for you to accept that a lot of us are watching you all throw your money away for entertainment, and have a very different opinion as to where GME will end up?  We are not shills, WSB is not one voice. Its this cult mentality,  its popped up everywhere during the pandemic. From BLM, to the Patriots, and now GME. Name a vague cause against the man, throw around a few conspiracy theories. And boom. Hordes of people follow like sheep. Furious with anyone who has a counter view. Check out the 'faith based' GME to the moon post on the Reddit frontpage. This is the new Prosperity Gospel and there's nothing you can say to change their minds until it's all long in the past yeah ive been procrastinating ever since i bought GME LOL Ey my fellow autistic degenerated fuckdolls.    * Wall street still view Gamestop as a brick and mortar company and bases their estimates on that. The neurodegenerative boomers are slowly waking up and this view is gradually changing. **When they finally understand that this is an e-commerce company the estimates and valuation *will* change.**  * Hedge funds and other **institutions *keeps* shorting**. Some are trapped and have no choice and others see it as a high risk high reward play. But we have hedge funds on our side as well. And they will help us reach escape velocity. The problem is not hedge funds, it's being able to short 140%.  * **Lots of options are ITM** and the total open interest is insanely high. It is rumored that CBOE is suspiciously quite about this.  * Since most of us are holding **the traded (real) shares is very low**. Some have mentioned 10m shares.  * No one thinks Gamestop will be the next Amazon. **But envision them having 1/10th of Amazon's market cap in a year or three.** That would put the share price at around 2000 dead presidents.  * **Ryan Cohen *is* taking over.** He built Chewy from nothing. He is in his fucking prime. This time he is not starting from zero.   * **ETF's *need* to buy more Gamestop** as the valuation grows to balance their funds.  * **There is *a lot* of money circulating at the moment.** The craziest bull market ever seen. This is perfect for Gamestop's situation.  *This is not financial advice. I enjoy painting with fecal matter.*  *Also, if you are tired of all the GME posts - sincerely, fuck you.*  💕🐱‍👤 If 100,000 people use their stimmy to buy GME at $100, it's 1,400,000 shares off the market *I enjoy painting with fecal matter too, I think I'll buy more GME* It's been said multiple times in multiple posts, but go watch the Uncle Bruce Says I Know What's Going On with GME video. My tarded smooth brain has been reading all you beautiful autists' laymen's-termed DD and it's all been wonderful and I've learned a lot, but something about Bruce's video explains the situation very clearly and has convinced me this squeeze is 100% going to happen, it's just a matter of patience and time, and probably not much of it, at that, either. Seriously considering going full retard on this one.  Not financial advice, I'm just a turnt up ape who wants to see nostalgia break through to the new age. This company needs to produce real results. All of this is just speculation.      I think $40 was a great price for the company, and DFV knows that. Now at $100+ it's in over-valued territory again. They have a lot of work to do, a lot to prove, and so if you are trying to determine the fundamental value then it is not yet $100.      The price is where it is because of MANY other factors, mostly supply and demand, a short float, aggressive short positions, aggressive long positions. Lots of money being made. This thing could just as easily go back to $500 for a day before crashing again.      At this point if you bought at $40 this is an investment. Sit back and check back in a year.     If you are a TRADER then you can buy at any price and make money, if you're lucky. If you buy at $100 and sell at $150. Amazing 50% return. But, most people are going to be greedy, hold on too long, not have any stop-losses and watch their 10 minute gain of 1000% become 20% become -25%. This is because most people, new retail investors, don't have the experience yet to realize the price movements of GME are not typical, not normal and people trade an entire year just to get 18% on their money, and consider that good. So if you are up 20%... please realize that's fantastic. I'm in GME, but ETFs are pressured to sell when the price goes up to keep their portfolios original balance. I hope some hedge fund that is long on GME comes out and blasts Melvin after this is done, we all know how egotistical wall street is so it wouldn't shock me Uh, ETFs need to SELL GME as the price goes up to balance their portfolios. They can't be having one stock worth too high of a percent of their fund. please be aware that alot of people are promoting Bruce, including shills.  I do not think Bruce is a shill but shills can donate to him and he reads their super chat in real time, affecting your viewpoint on GME in real time His new video, I think he is 100% right. Melvin and others have covered themselves. The bag holders are now everyone else.  [Bruce “Solves” GME](https: youtu.be/VwXLRoAw3Z4) When GME 🚀 🌝 all retards will no longer qualify for future stimmies If GME did an offering now it would end the squeeze. Bad advice 100BN market cap is easily obtainable by GME if they manage to transition If GME is valued as an online retailer (market cap) rather than a brick and mortar retailer (p/e, sales multiple, etc.) then $600/share is my target. That looks like it's the way to value it as well based on similar businesses.  Add that to the gamma squeeze potential then there's really no price I'd be shocked by $1k $2k $5k etc. That's the old ""derivatives time bomb"" potential and all I know is you want to be long the underlying when it goes off. You have to realize that this is much more complicated than most people realize. There are many MANY factors at play here.  * Investors of all types buying and selling constantly to make a buck. * Large institutional investors, ETFs, and Hedge Funds still shorting on a bet the stock will go down. Note that they did this on the last fall and made a ton of money. * Calls/puts being bought/sold and/or expiring.  One thing to remember about Friday is that a bunch of options would have been exercised in order to sell shares to make money. If you had a $50 call you purchased that expires on Friday, you would have doubled your investment by exercising/selling.  GME is a long play. The only way it works is for everyone to buy and hold. Unfortunately very few people are doing that. If you took every post here that claims to be buying and holding X amount of shares, it would equal 4X the amount of shares that are actually available. An influx of bots, alt accounts, etc. have made it very hard to understand the legit players. Even those that post 'proof' are typically just faking screenshots. I saw someone in the GME thread posted his so called proof, and it was clear he used the debugger console to modify the values, as he forgot a comma. If GME give me some stick, I'll give them my advices that will take us beyond the moon. IDK if your question was serious or not, but I'm going to answer anyway - and sound really stupid doing so because I'm just someone who doesn't play video games, never has, & I think the closest I've ever come to walking into one of these stores was dropping my son off at midnight to stand in line to get the newest Halo game. (As a book editor I'm ashamed of that run-on sentence).  So, according to the article, buying options is the **wrong** thing. I see a lot of people buying options when according to the article, they should be buying **shares** & holding so they can vote. The article says once you're a shareholder, write to the board, but it doesn't say about what (strategy ideas maybe?).   The article also mentions that the customers of Gamestop are mostly the older crowd. So I'd assume that they would want to appeal to the younger crowd now. Or how would they change their model to make more of the older crowd walk into their store, or ship from their locations to the homes? Hell, he made Chewy an online retailer, so why can't he do that with Gamestop? Why can't they be the #1 online retailer of games & partner with Microsoft?  It mentions getting the share price to $150 as a first step, and it's been working it's way up there. Yes, it mentions $500 but the dude can't expect miracles right off the rip, especially during Corona.  You guys have had ideas of merging GME & AMC before & I've heard of places forming what they've called ""teen nightclubs."" A city close to me just did something like this with an arcade, pool hall & movie theater, coffee shop, and McDonald's all attached. It's right in what they deem to be the ""town square"" (they're trying to bring back the old time feel). There's a beach down the road & a permit to carry alcoholic drinks from several bars was approved by the city last summer. Yeah, I know - a teen club + adults walking around with booze & a big body of water at the end of the road - recipe for disaster, right? But.. it is what it is! Sounds like a good time though!   Drop the kids off at the kiddie club, mom and dad head to the bar. They all meet up later in the town square.  So, the idea of AMC & GME may work for something like that. Hotels have been known to have theaters, arcades & bowling alleys, too.  So, there's my dumb idea. Bruh I'm all on board with GME but how? Many Republicans have decided they will vote for it. It's pretty much a given, and yes, I'm going to dump mine into GME provided that they don't require me to use 2020 earnings to qualify (I would be over the cut-off). Most people understand, but Elon Musk actually is not wealthy. The majority of his billions are 'paper wealth'. In other words, stocks and other non liquid assets. There is no way he could even dump a hundred million into GME. Gov stimulus and Viagra ain't got nothing on GME!!  GME the real stimmy!! Stupid question! What else would you do?   ...exept buying more GME.... ![img](emote|wsb_emojis|bull) Amateurs you say, but who is keeping GME at almost $100.00. I bet without us, GME could of been delisted and bankrupt by how illegally it was shorted. At this time I don't think GME is just a store. It represents our strength of what can be done when the little guy gets behind each other. That's what this is all about. Can you hear me now? it's actually about the tax implications for UK holders of GME I too had a dream that the daily gain display of my degiro account was just over €100,000. Incredibly lucid and detailed.   I did the maths and that means GME will be going up 200% in one day I presume this week. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD. Don't even buy if you will panic sell. GME is going to topple the entire thing. Then we can experience a free market once again You know i really enjoy jerking off, and before i wasn't interested in GME stonks (/s) but now you say there is DOUBLE the potential for jerking off? You son of a bitch, Im in. This is so important for everyone.  Imagine if you’d fully invested with margin.  The stock market tanks leaving the other stocks in your portfolio to drop like a rock.  And they keep those and sell your precious GME💎’s I’m a firm smooth brain but this could happen to a lot of people and allow hedges to steal your shares.    I think there’s a good possibility that GME will send a correction ripple to our over priced market.  We are dealing with shut downs and Covid yet the stock market is at all time highs.  The billionaires made so much on Covid it’s insane.  While the middle class got laid off and sent stimulus checks that can’t even pay for the rent and Heat bills.    Fuck this system.   I’m holding. Always been a fan of the underdog. Don’t know about the US rules but in EU, if you have stocks on margin and the broker gets broken, you can 👋 goodbye to your stocks. That is why in EU the margin is standard set on “off”, you have to manually set it “on” if you need the extra % of lending your shares out. So the risks is when you have shares on margin that you can lose them!! Especially now with GME...It is important to set it on “off” indeed! If I buy with money from my bank account then I’m good right ???    433.233 AMC avg 10.37 each  19.68 GME AT AVG 133.14 each so far ....  paid for with cash .....  from my checking account . Should I still move from RH well don't support RH just out of principal my friend lost out $40k in profile on GME from the first squeeze. During the hearing it was obvious they are in this for themselves and not the consumers, which as a business that's what they should go for to maximize the profile. However, if growing/protecting your business by harming your customer is not ethical and sadly the government will not do anything about it if anything just a light fine and probably won't see jail time tied to it. I hold when they do go IPO in march that everyone in WSB use every means to short the fuck out of RH and burn that shit to the ground. Yes, according to the hearing it was the gamma squeeze that caused RH to halt trades as it did not have enough capital to paid the fee to the clearing house and not enough shares in the open market to cover the call options and this may have resulted in bankruptcy for many financial institutional. But if they did make this mistake they should go into bankruptcy as for incompetency for allowing such thing to happen. Why do these billionaires have some special treatment when you see normal people who can't pay their bills they will receive foreclosure, credit balance closed, and if they fuck up at work they will be unemployed. This should be applied to the society as a whole and not just for the common people. Considering putting $2500 in GME should I buy now at the $100ish or see what happens Monday morning? suggestive adv for bullputspread on GME because rocket -but wait why DD: PRO's are buying GME on this date.....this is the way GME \*This is not financial advice and I’m not a licensed or registered securities analyst/provider. Basically, I know nothing so do listen to me. Just some context to what is happing and a guess on what the Pro's will do as they continue to manipulate GME.  Difference between Options and betting on a football game. Betting on a football game doesn’t affect the outcome. If enough people buy call options it can affect the outcome.  **Conclusion: Pro’s will BANG THE CLOSE on Thursday March 18th for April 1 Call options**  Apparently, the Pro’s are buying call option positions at the close somewhat near where the stock is trading (at the money) causing the market makers to delta hedge (estimated .66) and buy shares in the open market. For every contract (100 shares) the market makers sell at the money (near current price), they will need to hedge by buying about .66 (delta) shares on the open market. Buying pressure can increase the price sparking more interest (feedback loop).This is how the bet influences the outcome. This is the way.  The last two months they did it in the last trading week of the month. I’m thinking they could disguise their intent by executing their strategy the week before GME reports Q4 earnings. They haven’t been waiting til Friday so my guess is it would take place earlier maybe on Wednesday or Thursday. Friday the 19th is Quadruple Witching day so volatility in the overall market will be higher.  BANG THE FORUM would also fuel the rocketship. Hedge Funds are spying on the reddit forum (Point 2). They have programs to scrape every letter on this forum and calculate sentiment.  I could see them buying contracts and faking an increase in sentiment by posting the letters GME in a lot of replies so it looks like [r/wallstreetbets](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) are about to go gang busters on GME. If the letters GME show up in many post replies then everyone will be thinking that redditors are about to buy a lot of GME. The idiot hedge funds will go out and buy stock/options to front run the retail investor. If the [r/wallstreetbets](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) crowd also included “GME” in replies it could further fuel it as the Pro’s manipulate the market. This is the way.  [**Point 0: Movement in GME is repeatable (feedback loop)**](https: www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/25/nothing-specific-caused-gamestop-rally-says-strategist.html?&qsearchterm=Nothing%20specific%20caused%20GameStop%20rally)  (click up here \^\^\^ for CNBC video \^\^\^)  Catalyst relatively simple (feedback loop)….we started to tick up on Thursday and got above $50. THEN major option trades went off fueling the rocketship to the moon! Parabolic!!  2:58pm stock at $53, 750 contracts at $50 strike expire tomorrow (1 day) paid $6.85 (about $500k). Within 10 mins stock at $68 or so and not long later dropped to $60  3:27pm stock at $60.80, 400 contracts at $60 strike $7.75 (about $300k)  (Feedback loop) People on the other side of the trade (sellers of contracts) have to hedge and buy shares. Craziness will happen with only 20 minutes left to the close. All this from ONLY $800k in call option activity!! That’s nothing….a little skeptical.  [**Point 1: SEC former regulator foreshadows next squeeze (End of March)**](https: www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/26/there-are-institutional-traders-behind-gamestop-frenzy-former-sec-regulator.html)  (click up here \^\^\^ for CNBC video \^\^\^)  First Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the January  Second Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the February (not as many short sellers)  Projected Third Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the March (huge month for trade, month and quarter end)  **Point 2: Hedge Funds spying on** [r/wallstreetbets](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)\*\*, use it against them\*\*  Investors (HF’s, Institutions, etc.) are paying service providers to spy on the forum and count everytime someone mentions Gamestop or the ticker. They are tracking the sentiment of the forum to front run the action. If you talk about Gamestop a lot and type in the ticker then each mention gets counted and if there is a significant increase then the HF’s may consider buying the stock and/or options to participate in any increase before it goes parabolic.  **Point 3: Q4 2020 earnings expected to be out in “late March”**  I expect the earnings date will be announced two weeks prior, so that puts you around March 8th Monday to March 11th Thursday. Earnings date probably between 23rd to the 25th, two weeks after the announcement of the date.  11/24/2020 (Tuesday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/08/2020 (Tuesday)  08/26/2020 (Wednesday) GME announces Q2 earnings release on 09/09/2020 (Wednesday)  05/28/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q1 earnings release on 06/09/2020 (Tuesday)  03/12/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q4 earnings release on 03/26/2019 (Thursday)  11/25/2019 (Monday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/10/2019 (Tuesday)  **Point 4: Options Cubed - GME is spring loaded for volatility**  The somewhat binary outcome of survive or die combined with a very credible activist investor (Ryan C.) is accelerated with material changes and establishing a better alignment with the secular tailwinds of gaming.  Buying call options is like an option on an option on an option, Options Cubed. For that reason, you would expect them to be priced accordingly. However, even after the first squeeze massively help by the short sellers, we sat in the $40-$60 range with out of the money call options price extremely cheap. As if they were normal options. Let’s see how cheaply someone is willing to sell a $70 call option if this stock tanks to the $50s next week.  **Point 5: Probability says buy April 1 Call options**  You don’t know when the parabolic moves will happen but the media clips above in point 2 suggest it will happen in the last week of the month. Since you don’t know when, the task is the following:  Detail Outcomes --> Assign Probabilities (subjective) --> Calculate Expected Value  Lets say next week GME drops to the $50-$60 range and out of the money call options are cheap like the aftermath of the first squeeze.  15x return --> 10% chance of another move just simply to $100 (a $60 Strike call option would be worth about $45 to $60 with a stock price move to $100 again)  0x return --> 90% chance we never get above $50 again  Expected Value = (15x \* .1) + (0x \* .9) = 1.5x return  On average a 50% return is expected. So if you think there is a greater than 10% chance of another move to $100 once it falls to the $50-$60 range then the expected return only goes up assuming you can get at least a 15x return on your contract. so spamming GME to the MOON! repeatedly is...good?

Yes, that is what I'm saying the Pro's could do around March 18th to manipulate the sentiment calculator which will look like there are so many more people talking about GME.  The problem is that they probably programmed it to only count one GME per post to remove the distortion one person could make when spamming it.

[https: chartstar.com/blog/stock-mentions-on-wallstreetbets-plotted-against-price/](https: chartstar.com/blog/stock-mentions-on-wallstreetbets-plotted-against-price/) Hahaha I’m fully aware. Just thought it was funny. You should check out the amount of put options on sp500 indexes for March 19. Big money betting on big downturn. Also, there’s a bunch of purchased puts on large sp500 that have nothing to do with GME for March 19 and the week afterwards. Somebody is prepping to profit off of large market downturn. Yea, I just looked and there is a TON of put option open interest on that expiration date.  There is also a lot of open call option activity (17.7k contracts) on GME at $800 for the March 19th expiration. South Park really need to make a GME episode. after GME moon maybe we short the shit out of this Robinhood train wreck. I've never shorted a stock before, but I'm also a bit of a retard. After this saga, two things are possible:  Shorting becomes illegal - Win  Shorting stays legal and Robinhood becomes the most shorted stock in history making the 140% on GME look like Manute fucking Bol - Win They manipulate you those here! Everyone who entered GME in 130 $ 140 $ is losing those of the first entered in 300 is losing those who organized won a lot .. they are the same as the funds 💩 Sounds like GME/meme stocks might make them go bankrupt without this rushed IPO liquidity injection. Sure other platforms also halted but if the majority of apes are on Robinhood, which going off screenshots here it looks like a lot of apes are on RH yolo’ing on OTM options that return 1000+ return gains, then maybe they’re not ready for paying out the shareholders. Story might end up as a bankrun of RH but in a form of paying out GME shareholders until they can no longer and go bankrupt....any thoughts? I'm going to invest in RH because I fucking hate GME apes. You want to see a real counter movement? But guys, what if we short them and accidentally trigger a GME-like short squeeze on RH IPO They restricted SNDL as well Don’t forget where your extra funds came from WSB Boost SNDL next week to gain more for the GME and AMC run All the best.

We are GME AMC CTRM crew! Our ships are coming HF!!! Be rady 🚀🚀🚀 Bumping this on my way to GME to buy the new super mario game Jesus bro you are talented, glad to have you as part of the GME gang! Enjoyed is an understatement. I loved it! I have been playing the classic guitar since age 8, and let me tell you, you have incredible talent and you are working hard to make something out of it. Talent alone without work is wasted, work without talent is pointless. You have it all right there. No idea if you hold GME, but if you do, I hope it turns out well so you can continue to do what you obviously love. Personally, I hope I will be able to afford a few guitars I have always wanted and some recording equipment so I can do what you do. Godspeed my friend! What would happen if every person with a share in GME bought a Gamestop membership? Heres the thing. GameStomp is getting so much free advertising from this that they are gonna get cool again. People will associate the store with sticking it to the man for years to come. You literally cant buy that, but if you tried you'd spend hundreds of millions of real dollars with no guarantee of sucess. GME just got that ad campaign for free. I SAY THAT A VALUATION OF $1,000 IS FULLY JUSTIFIED BY THE INCREASE IN GOODWILL ALONE. Thats just science. I love a meme that said ""When you have \_\_\_\_\_ shares of GME and you go to a Gamestop shop like undercover boss"" Does the membership program give me a discount on GME stock? Citron tweeted that GME should acquire some 300 million market cap esport company. Unfortunately for Citron, Cohen is way ahead I bet GME may have the potential to dictate the course of the entire market. I did some research & analysis. Before I start, I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD, and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized. Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!  **Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.  New York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings  Nasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)  **TLDR;/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didn’t suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies/positions.  **In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.  **TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\*\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\*\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)  **START**  I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, I’ve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.  &#x200B;  [GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https: preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)  If you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are “coincidences” as many have suggested.  **PROCESS**  I calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.  &#x200B;  [Covariance & Correlation Matrices.](https: preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)  [P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https: preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)  The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on “luck” or “chance”. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to “luck”. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.  **So, what does this mean?**  **My opinions.**  To me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.  My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.  **Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**  Anyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.  I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR  **Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much  I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of ""correlation does not imply causation"". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **""strength""** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term ""significant"" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little ""\*"" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims "" helps turn food into cellular energy\*"" while other vitamins make claims with no ""\*"".  In layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.  Also, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.  So with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.  Lastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https: firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.  Other than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!  **Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.  [u\/big\_boolean Graph](https: preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)  For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.  **Edit#3** I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields. If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better. **Pointing out problems/faults is important, but providing actionable solutions even more so!** So this means i actually accidently doubled down on my GME posistion by shorting the nasdaq. Funny. So buy the dips of both, and profit double? GME up: buy broad market ETFs for my Roth IRA at a discount. Market up: Buy GME at a discount. I was originally a hard skeptic -- how can one little company with a 7 billion overpriced valuation disrupt a 60 Trillion dollar system? But after some thought, I think you're right.  In fact, only a very tiny number of traders are responsible for price moves. Most people do not trade stocks every day, so most of the money is static. No trade, no price change. A few hundred people with a few thousand dollars each can cause billions of dollars of ""valuation"" to appear or evaporate if they all trade the same direction on the same stock.   Think that through to its logical conclusion -- there's a multiplier effect over decades of population growth and wealth growth among traders putting the market out of sync with the real economy. The whole market is propped up to the wazoo compared to the GDP.  (pause) I just did a little research and found out Warren Buffet was a few years ahead of me. It's called the Buffet Indicator, and apparently it's never been higher.  [https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffett\_indicator](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffett_indicator)  Yikes! I've never been more terrified of this market. This shit really is happening. GME for the break!  100 shares averaged to $98. HODL! Very interesting read. What i took from that, is once gme pops off, like REALLY pops off, and its at the point where its time for us to sell, the market will be low enough and we will have the money enough, to invest in more mainstream stocks, and significantly increase the wealth of the working class (most of us i assume) while having the power to impact and influence the entire market in a greater sense than we ever have before. This could change everything if we try. Did this just become bigger than GME??? This has happened before, check out the Panic of 1901 with the Northern Pacific rail stock. Interesting how closely it resembles GME.  https: novelinvestor.com/the-biggest-short-squeeze-of-the-last-century /How big is the sample, what a “bunch”means in numbers?  65 stonks of GME 💎🤚 Is this actually a big suprise? Hedgies have to sell billions of positive positions to raise capital to cover their shorts. Until this mess is over with some major market maker or clearing house imploding, the GME short squeeze will always pull the market down.  And oh boy if Citadel or DTCC goes under be prepared for Leaman'esque level of drops. I will continue to Buy GME and hope others do. We buy what we want unless you want Charlie Munger and the Big Dogs to dictate to the ordinary investor what we can or can not do. So let's test your work.  We need to get GME over $10,000 which should totally fuck my other stocks, but I'll still have a massive WIN.  YES, I love fucking statistics. Fck that's a lot of words  I'm just going to hold on and buy more GME 🚀 Is it possible that the “irrational price” of GME creates uncertainty in the general stock market. If you’re a boomer investor looking at stocks, and you’re told a mob of internet investors are pushing stocks, you might want to liquidate and hold as USD, as the equities market would seem risky as a whole.  I’m holding a couple GME, I’m hoping the shorts are selling to cover their positions, but I honestly think it’s more just general uncertainty in the market Great writing. I had similar feeling before. I am glad to see the statistics to prove it.  One thing I would like to suggest is to pick the data sets when GME has significant change, for example 5%, 10%, 30%, and more than 30%. I am assuming there were very strong correlation at certain level of change, maybe above 30%? You may plot correlation value against the % GME change. Would be interesting to see.  The conclusion I may want to draw is that the current market is so highly leveraged that ""significant"" change on some stock can make tsunami across the whole market.  And yes, GME is the hot topic no matter how much the main street media wants it to go away at this point. This makes sense. Confidence plays a significant part in the market. GME's volatility initiate a confidence change in the market. The change can be just because it's new and might become less significant going forward, but it's there.  People, generally, sell when they think something bad will happen (fundamentals be damned ""Show me the fundamentals, says the talking heads""). And they buy when they think something good will happen (again, no change in fundamentals). So what you’re saying, buy and hold GME shares.   Buy Puts on everything else. GOT IT Nice.  can you rerun correlation using only days or hours in which the is a 10% movement in GME price or more? My hypothesis is that many factors weigh on the overall market,  but *big* moves in GME overwhelm other forces  at those times. HOLY FUCK! That made my brain freeze and I'm not even eating ice cream!  You're way too fucking smart for me dude!  But I LOVE that you proved we can break Wallstreet! That's awesome! The little guys can take down the big guys! No way!  Just don't make GME so expensive that I can't afford it when I get paid Wednesday! Please! Is GME the only stock this is happening with or are there others? (Besides the other ones that get lumped in with GME like AMC, etc) If this is even remotely true, then cashing out for tendies by pushing GME will annihilate every single normal person in the world's savings who have been investing in stocks the last few years trying to grow their money. You'd literally just be the same as Melvin. K then. That’s enough of GME thanks If this is the case, and the squeeze will send GME higher triggering liquidation, I highly suggest looking at JDST as a complementary rocket ship. JDST is a Gold Inverse ETF, with Gold as high as it is when the market drops Gold sells off. During the 2020 crash JDST spiked to $800.  I'm not an advisor, this is not financial advice, my brain is as smooth as an egg. I am just going to point this out, because you are ignoring one of the natural consequences of being right (assuming you are correct). I know I will get downvoted for this, but whatever.  Basically, if one stock can have a squeeze that will cause significant disruption in the market the SEC might decide it should halt trading on that stock. In other words your options and positions lost lots of value over that significant decision. Due to the noise around GME, I am sure the SEC would rather let things play out, but ultimately when push come to shove they will act and it will not be pleasant.  Trade smart. If you are going to trade on the idea that contributing to a squeeze will make you win, just be prepared for when the mechanisms in place that have the power to combat such market manipulation go into effect. Great post. One question u/AR334. How many sample do you have when you estimate the p values? Do you use the YTD time courses of these indices and GME stock ? I noticed the GME market pattern as well and was scoffed at too a bit. I didn't go as deep as you did wow! Incredible. Too bad I can't read or do math. Kudos to OP. This is makes so much more sense than what we saw yesterday with hyped date predictions and AI models theatricals from fame seeker.   This is the only way to show why buying GME makes sense. Lets see how this pans out. Hold on, so you're telling me you think investing in GME will bring down the entire market, and, give me a minute, you think that would be a good idea.   The thing is, I don't think you're wrong, but you should probably take into account the psychology- a very visible irrational GME number is telling everyone the market is unstable, freaking them out, and making them want to sell.   I however, just a piddly nobody with less than 30k in my 401k turned IRA cannot pull that shit off the market once I put in. I'm sure lots of brokeass people are in the same boat.  My point is, DEAR BABY JESUS STAHP. What is the p value supposed to measure? What is the actual statistic test? Correlation between prices? Prices cannot be correlated like that as each price is not independent of the previous nor the next. It’s a time series and there is an entire branch of statistics on how you analyze and compare them. What you probably want to do is an independence test on the time series of each price and then also correct for multiple comparisons. Otherwise you violate the most fundamental statistical assumption about independence of observations and any p value you conjure up is just junk.   Also the idea that GME - a what? 5B cap stock? will control a hundreds-of-trillions market is just absurd. 'I have a scientific background' - then ignores that correlation does not equal causation. Are you using statistics to prove something you have a functional explanation for or are you just connecting the fact that the GME saga has occurred during general down turns using a few data points in time. You're a moron. Could also work the other way round ie. Market goes down and people buy in GME for some reason The first time GME spiked, it nearly led to contagion, and likely caused a minor flash crash from starting liquidation of blue chips.  The second market dip from rising GME was not necessarily liquidation but observers/bots looking at patterns that the last time GME spiked, there was a market dip, and so they shifted positions in advance accordingly, which leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy of a price dip. This may repeat itself in the future.  Naked shorting penalties should be enforced because of the carnage they cause. So this is the devil's advocate for the DTC raising requirements that day?   They didn't do it to necessarily screw GME holders they did it to prevent the entire market from seizing up. With the retards still being Melvin for causing this situation. Correct. Typically short positions should benefit from a broader market sell-off, however in the case of GME which happened to be over-shorted, the dynamics changed... making it a risky play susceptible to other shorts covering to free up cash, which would cause a chain effect pushing prices higher against all the short participants in the stock.   \---   Generally Hedge Funds pride themselves on being ""hedged"" with short bets that make money on market slides, even if their long bets are losing money. But in this situation of being over-shorted, GME was no longer a good hedge against market sell-offs.  \---  We might get to a point where most hedge funds abandon shorting GME, and the short interest drops back down to around 5% only, which is much less than today. This could happen despite the price of GME being much higher than it is today, similar to what happened with TSLA. >Okay, so de-margin my Tesla, put it all into GME, wait for SQUOZE, cash out, put back into TSLA at bottom? Not saying it will happen but it almost sounds like if the market actually crashes, it would send GME and AMC to Valhalla but not for the reasons OP listed. I mean the correlation listed is still there but it’s due to de-risking. Interesting. But it would also mean, if the market continues to slide, and shorts have already covered causing a squeeze, AMC and GME sell off would happen pretty quick after the initial squeeze reaction and longs and shorts rebalance on it them. >WHY GME NOT AT 10K yet????  Were it so easy... Thanks for the insight. I’ve been seriously considering being super boring and tossing my GME profits into boomer plays like BRK. Might toss some calls on top of the shares just to keep things WSB quality YOLO into GME calls next week? Rack up that debt and cash in that 401k for some GME. The big spikes are my GME shares and one April 200c  Edit: other positions, bunch of ARKF calls that went to shit, 100 PLTR shares at 25 avg. calls on XOM and BP for July. couple other things in the red FINRA data now shows over 67 million GME short volume over the past 3 days.

Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want!

There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xw8lu1l122k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=644af631e8387d60cb475e33e67fcd1c66018b8d 57% short volume is due probably in large part to dynamic delta gamma hedging by market makers, and momentum algorithm bots from quantitative funds. There were 300,000 0DTE feb 26 contracts open all day yesterday. That's insane and it means 30,000,000 shares of the underlying are pinned to the options market.  As the price of the underlying moves around, market makers need to buy shares, sell shares, buy back sold short shares, or sell short shares to zero out their delta.  300,000 0DTE contracts is insane. Because of how they hedge, this forms a massive structure or system with somewhat predictable outcomes. The share price is a derivative of option order flows, and option order flows are a derivative of the share price. In physics that looks like the wave equation. The result is you get fuck tons of all sorts of volume, because outside buying disturbs the system.  On Thursday around noon, I correctly predicted GME to $105 at close by Friday, by analyzing option order flows, put call skew, and the sheer outsized affect they have on the underlying of GME. As of Feb 25th, ""EX AR TEE"" holds **517,738** shares of GME, not 1.1million as you said.

So the source isn’t that off of the official one AMC/GME STONKS: YOU MUST HAVE A CASH ACCOUNT!! How do I transfer ONLY my GME shares to TD? Since they will reimburse ACAT transfers apparently? I want to keep RH for free option trading. For some reason I have been getting better pricing on options with RH vs Thinkorswim. Is GME gonna tank Monday open? What would you rather happen? People who originally got in GME on Robinhood (before they got fucked by Robinhood) bought several thousand dollars worth of shares and are still holding. If they want to get off Robinhood, that means they have to sell their shares. Is it hold or sell? At least they’re still in the game holding retard. How it feels investing in GME GME YOLO month-end update — Feb 2021 will this man become a billionaire fueled by GME, we sure hope so Is GME a buy for Monday? We retail. Only way to survive. Put all yr f. ' money on $GME please. We can really make this thing. Just believe in a better world. Thanks. I’m new to Reddit and this GME thing and I’m coming in on the end but I’ll throw 1K at it. YOLO right? GME during the correction GME is doomed if all of you are this misinformed.

The size of them works out perfectly, along with all the ""milk"" shooting would could have been us jizzing all over those fuckers! Ok that was simply retarded. Just buy GME and bankrupt the Hedge Funds. The Southpark thing was better $GME 130 shares for $120.5. I’ll buy on Monday more or I’ll hold I don’t care. I like the dips and the stock 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎 GME will 10x before AAPL. You should re-balance this high growth portfolio properly. Heard you guys like outlandish GME gain porn. MY LOTTO TICKET 🎟 GME! 💎 ✋ 🚀👩‍🚀 💰🤑💸💲 #Better chances of winning with GME then the lotto ( not financial advise) Congrats in advance when GME hits $400 I should have bought the GME dip but I've got a lot dogged into AMC best luck with your conquest GME brethren! What's with the scribble, bb ashamed to get roasted for GME being 100% of portfolio? 😂 It’s so weird that on this very wednesday (24/2)I saw GME at 46 lol. I cannot grap why some retail traders would even dare buying those shares at 100 or more. I feel like this trend is attracting some traders in a way that in the long run will not be good for them. I feel some newbies are not even interested in learning, taking 15 minutes of their time to check graphs that any new trader could understand. Hell, I placed 10k on AMC at 8, and I’ve seen people buying at 14, 15, thinking it will reach 500. My gold to go rule is selling as soon as I double. Delete yourself and take all of these stupid GME/social movement apes with you. Bunch of stupid kids or even stupider adults jumping on a bandwagon and parroting the same shit over and over like you’re in a fucking cult. Be gone. There’s even a GME sub you fucks can fuck off to. Wall Street bets is a gambling sub where people discuss short term investments in order to make money. Not a sub for actual fucking dumb asses to buy the same few stocks and then demonstrate how stupid they are over and over by letting everyone know every five minutes that they have diamond hands. Shorts, lots of them, apart borrowing shares for shorts I don’t think it’s possible to go above 100%.   GME mutual fund ownership is 3192 %, AMC at 3000% ish, PLTR at 182%, BA at 1700% since everyone expect it to sink after the lost motor.  What is going on right now is absolutely crazy. I’m thinking about getting in RKT and a few others. Did the same thing with 180c, similar losses. Saw us maintaining at 170 and thought we could margin call somebody. Thought I got a great fill. Literally 5 minutes after the order went through, short attack started.  In hindsight, should've paper handed eod thurs to dodge IV crush, but well... I'm retarded. There was a blip in there that I was up about 5%, how I miss seeing green.  GME has really fucked my perception of IV. How can anyone look at 400% and think ""these are rookie numbers"", but that's exactly what I did. Wow, I had AMC 1DTE too which expired worthless yesterday, but I only put in $700. Are you seriously telling me you put 100k into GME options AFTER the pop w 1400% IV?   Wow... I am shocked how many people here post their gain/loss porn in the $100k+ range, and they’re using mother fucking Robinhood.  I know, that’s where I started out too, but damn if I don’t feel a bit of mystery behind the company since day 1, well before the GME debacle started.  Even that entire situation aside, I feel my money and trading are safer with a solid broker. And I make tiny trades in relation to these guys. That's because I YOLO'd the moving expenses into GME. Sorry? GME goes up Monday, everything else will crash So buy more GME calls. Got it As awesome as that sounds, don't put all of that into GME. I know you didn't specify how much you were gonna buy, but just wanted to put that out there. I've got money tied up in something that might never moon again, so don't risk too much. Congrats on the check though! Bruh do not buy GME with your inheritance check. Buy PLTR, it's at a great price right now. GME gonna burn ya. This is a very important point. Also ISM and ADP reports on Monday and Wednesday might hint if the forecast of +105,000 for Feb is realistic. Let’s hope the forecast is way off like in Jan.   Only thing I plan to do Monday to Thursday is buy more GME if it slips below $80. Nice. There is a real chance that the hedge funds win and pound GME back to $40. Not saying that that's guaranteed, but you have to factor in the possibility. Very long post summarising hundreds of years worth of short squeezes.  Edited for formatting.  Positions: GME 65 shares @ $105.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/eddie-gilbert-the-boy-wonder-of-wall-street#:~:text=On%20June%2012%2C%201958%2C%20the,remaining%2050%25%20of%20Bruce%20stock.  Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.  The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis  Saunders vs. the Shorts Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.   The Shorts Are Cornered Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.   Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.   https: www.americanheritage.com/jacob-schiff-and-northern-pacific-corner#2  In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.  Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.  On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.  Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.  By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.  Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.  The New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.  https: www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26 https: www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.  Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.  At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.  VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.  The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.  In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.  “The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.  “In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”  Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.  Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.  “We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”  Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.  It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”  Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.  The “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.  Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.  “Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.  Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.  Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.  VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING? Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.  This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.  Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.  “The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.  Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.  But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.  When asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”  The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.  https: www.marketwatch.com/story/squeeze-on-goldman-put-falcone-in-penalty-box-2013-08-21  Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.  He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.  In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.  Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.  It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.  As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.  In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.  Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.  Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)  This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.  That’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.  Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.  The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.  “Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.  I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.  “Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.  https: moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/  [Removed to keep within character limit]  https: nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/  After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.  The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.  But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.  Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.  The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.  Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.  “There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.  Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.  Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”  Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.  Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.  “Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.  Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.  But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.  “We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.  Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.  Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.  Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.  Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.  https: medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d  The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.  At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.  With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.  Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.  Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda: “Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.” This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.  Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.  Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.  Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned. Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.  Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.  From The Great Game:  “Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”  Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”  Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”  Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.  “The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‘short of Harlem’, meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’” What’s interesting is that in the past the short squeezes were mostly orchestrated by one individual/entity.  With GME and AMC, it’s an unknown mix of retail, whales, and rival hedgefunds. While we may appear to have a single hive mind here, what’s going to work against us are differing sell points and determination to hold. I have no direct evidence but there are coincidence and conflict so I would like to straight it out as a reference for the once in history event.  A little background first.  * 1/13/2021 - 1/27/2021, GME price went from \~20 to \~350. * 1/28/2021 Robinhood implemented buy restriction on GME. This restriction was fully removed on 2/5 (**Friday**). 7 trading days but 9 days include weekend. In between there were partial restriction that is almost the same as full restriction. * During that time period, GME closed down on 1/28, but higher on 1/29 (Friday). Big drops for the next 4 days (Mon - Thur) from \~350 to \~53. The next day they fully removed the buy restriction, and the price went up to \~63. That's **Friday**.  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/llgbvn5cd4k61.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=1825434b6e2855764a7776708dd5998437860f53  I was puzzled by the timing.  * The **up trend** is still intact up to 1/29, the second day into restriction even though there was big drop the day before, when the buy restriction was implemented. If the restriction was removed then the up trend would most likely still in place, even enhanced.  1. Several other platform had restriction on 1/28 but no more the next day (Please help to verify this). Why R still has the restriction? 2. News reported that R **raised 1B on 1/29, and another 2.4B on 2/1 (Monday when another big drop happened). If there restriction was based on the capital requirement by DTCC, would this 3.4B more than enough to fulfill that requirement(<1B as we now know)?** Why did they still keep that restriction? Earlier that week citadel provided 2B bailout to short seller Melvin.  * The **down trend** starting from 2/1 lasted 4 days until 2/4 Thursday. The big drop on 2/4 knocked GME from 91 to 53. At this point if it went down even more( 35 level on the left side plateau) it would likely bounce back hard from there. **The more the compress, the more the explosion power.** The restriction was **fully removed on 2/5 the next day Friday**. It was perceived as a good news but people tend to be cautious during Friday because of uncertainty of weekend. This seems to be calculated, well timed action to reduce big swing. The price had relatively small bounce back, which slowed the downward pressure but at the same time released the explosive power from the compression. It’s simple.  They lent money to people on margin trades to short these stocks and their own clients could not cover their own margin calls.  When the clients cannot cover and default, RH is on the hook to cover for them. RH didn’t have the money to do that since all their clients with smooth brains were buying their hearts out.   RH was being forced to cover for defaulting clients in short positions by going to the exchanges and getting more shares to use internally off the market.  This was breaking their backs.  Remember, GME peaked at $2900 for some RH clients.  That puts GME 70million shares at 203 BILLION dollars value.  RH was going to end up defaulting to citadel, which would have defaulted to the clearing house, which would have forced citadel to liquidate literally everything.    TL:DR buy and hold Position 1GME at $45, Monday all in now that RH is in E*TRADE. Why I think GME will never go below 45$ again. After the first godly squeeze in January and the artificial fall, I and I’m sure many other apes felt that we lost the fight (war or whatever you want to call it). A few weeks go by and the stock keeps falling slowly but surely which led the majority if us to believe it is a thing of the past. Many analysis and DDs and news showed that shorting went down to 60% (from over 100%) so everything seemed negative for us average rookie investors (which im sure is the majority). Keeping in mind I am now bag holding my 87% loss and thinking it is not even worth selling anymore so might as well forget it about it (diamond hands but it was very sad hands).  Moving to the present, all the ape shit that happened starting with the hearing, DFV doubling down and stock rocketing. I averaged down to 130$ from 270$, which was an easy decision for me so I’m thinking it was the same for people in my position.  I was watching the stock yesterday at 101$ and the ask was soooo not random as notmally it is because they were thousands of calls in 101.xxx which is what I guess what reddit calls a ladder attack. And the shares being borrowed and now it makes sense to me what they are doing!!! Which im sure everyone like myself with a smooth brain finally understand on some level the game!!!  So now I’m thinking since I have 5 times bigger bag at 130$ average, and other apes that did the same thing own more stocks of GME, plus we are optimistic now. As a result this means we will be holding the line stronger than the first time, so it shouldn’t go below the 45$ margin which it was at in the weeks after the first fall.  P.S. this is obviously not financial advice, and obviously you could tell I’m so bad at stock analysis and math. This is just how I am feeling right now and what my smooth brain concluded.  Anyone else feels the same way? The fact your inner appraisal is in the ballpark of $45 tells me your not picking up on the silver lining. With everyone holding for any number of reasons, it allows GME to move forward in a way that favors long term and isn't worried about short term. This is good when your a long bet, but for the company it represents a gigantic catalyst. I would guess that with a retail presence online, and the emphasis of the members club taking a lot more of the focus the proper bottom for this stock is much closer to $100 than $45. This is a decent baseline, but it would only take the smallest partnership or acquisition to dramatically reposition themselves. MLG/game battles would be happy to make a strong partnership if GME chooses to shift towards Esports or gaming lounges in general, but if the hype from GME allows them to outright purchase that expansion then the company is facing barriers entirely of its own design at that point. I think GME Stock will be the new currency of the people as inflation continues to fuck the USD If you buy the few thousand dollars now instead of waiting until it, potentially never, goes back down to 45, then it will help move the price up sooner  Or do you think GME IS NOT WORTH 100!? There isn't a pocket of dumb money on the planet that wouldn't swarm well before it hit 40 at this point, its going to get interesting. I honestly don't see it below 90-100 again any time soon for this reason, people have already bought the hype and GME has quietly made big moves. 95% of GME posts are from ""apes"" who have no fucking idea what they're talkin about. What will 10x first, GME or AAPL from here? oh dude I see where you went wrong lol.. you misspelled GME! Stonks\* only go up. Only GME and AMC Think I might cop some GME , I’m off Monday as well let’s see 👀 What you're really missing out on is a chance to proclaim your idiocy to other idiots.   Check out Stocks With Bruce, he seems to know what he's talking about.   If you're not here for long term investments, you're better off taking what money you're willing to put into GME and livestream yourself lighting it on fire. I promise you that.   This is not financial advice. If you applied the Buffet quote to GME you could have double dipped and made fat profits. Just by following a simple saying. The GME newbies who are part of some social movement need to see this and understand it. Take profits. # Typically, covered calls provide a laughable premium while capping your potential gains.  Let’s use AMD as an example as it looked Friday at close. Going by the book for covered calls, I selected an option with an expiration date just over 28 days away with a delta close to 0.40. This is an 87.50C that expires 26 March 2021. AMD closed at $84.51 when the mid price for this option was $3.07. Purchasing 100 shares of AMD for $8451 and selling this option for $307 costs us $8144 and caps our max gains at $606 or 7.4%. You might as well put your money in a CD or buy a treasury bond, amiright?  Now let’s run the numbers for GME ($101.74) using an option with the same expiration and similar delta. This is a 280C which had a mid price of $20.03 at close. Purchasing 100 shares of GME for $10174 and selling the 280C for $2003 costs us $8171 and caps our max profit at $19829 or 242.7%.  Here's a table for some reason.  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/1i8xsv5wu3k61.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d955bbeedd0451c1feaf19040d1675468ea1301  Options quotes can be found [here](https: oic.ivolatility.com/oic_adv_options.j;jsessionid=b7t3rFfOTY9h).  # What’s the downside?  1. $19.8k is not the moon 2. $8171 is a high entry point vs buying FDs 3. Paper handing the shares before the call expires is risky unless you buy/close the call  # What’s the upside?  1. This creates upward buying pressure with less money 2. You paid $8171 for $10174 worth of shares 3. Dividends pay out 15 March  # Additional Considerations  1. GameStop’s earnings report is projected to release on 1 April but could release as early as 25 March 2. A squeeze could happen and the price could dip before your call is exercised 3. I have no idea what I’m doing and I'm not recommending this as a strategy  None of this is financial advice. I just started trading stocks this week and don’t understand why the colorful lines aren’t moving on my screen today.  EDIT: Fixed link to find options quotes.  Edit 2: Fixed table. Also, Please keep roasting this idea. That's how we all learn. Another downside is that the stock plummets and you’re left holding stock that has lost more than your premium was. Which is likely and why the premiums are so high due to that volatility.  I hold 17 GME @320 btw. Sure. You essentially lower your strike from ~$101 to $81 and have upside to $280.  It’s a good trade if you like the stonk   BUT-  1. Creates upward buying pressure with less money” - no not really. You buy 100 shares of GME for $10K. You sell a .4d call for $2K. The dealer is shorting 40 shares against their short call option immediately. The net result in the stock market is a buy of 60 shares ($6000) for your $8000 purchase.  3. GME doesn’t pay a dividend  Also use https: optionstrat.com/ Not an excel spreadsheet. Highly recommend for anyone looking at options. Play around with the dates etc. look at how the option moves over time. It seems that GME has no stock expiration date on eToro. I assume this is because on eToro you buy the underlying asset? Yes, so buy 100 shares of GME @ 10000, write a 5.00 covered call, grab a net credit of 9500, max risk 500.  Essentially hitting the ask with 100 volume and only risking 500.   But, there's a chance somehow you don't get assigned, in which case they don't take the hundred shares.  So you have the 9500 credit, and the 100 shares, essentially landing you 100 shares for 500 bucks.  10000 out, 9500 right back in, 500 MIA until the contract is exercised and the 100 shares are called away... But if the shares aren't called away, you have 500 MIA and you keep the 100 shares.  That's what I mean.  It's so stupid and so low-risk that I'm gonna try No one thinks that the $1.9 trillion stim being passed in the house and the Johnson and Johnson FDA approval for emergency rollout of their vaccine are strong bullish signals for recovery stocks? IDK about bond rates and I think after next week many will see the potential in Oil, many already have. That’s what I’m in. Of course I am holding GME and some AMC because they are obviously sound financial investments. I think if we don’t bounce next week we will soon. I am dip buying all the way down. Thank you $GME gang, took a loan late December (proof in a previous comment I made) GME was my first play here, paid off before the first interest! Feels like a GOD to play the system this way. Took out a loan to buy GME, diamond balls sir, diamond balls 💎🙌🦍here. I wrote some basic advice I'll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action, or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper-handing. Paper-handing is fundamentally bad investment practice, especially if you're a new investor. I'll explain why.  *DISLAIMER: I've only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff, and he hasn’t steered me wrong yet. So take it for what it’s worth... But based on all the fact that paper-handing is even an issue here, you apes clearly need this advice.* ***EDIT: These are ""fundamentals"" to the way I trade, but obviously everyone's trading strategy is different. Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing, which doesn't encourage YOLO-ing. This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to ""outsmart"" the general public by spotting opportunities/value before the market does. I feel it's particularly relevant to the GME play. The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it. There are other approaches (which often require more experience) but I feel this is most accessible to new investors. GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything. Well, everything that you don’t think will go bankrupt or get delisted.***  **New traders, or people who are thinking of becoming new traders, should read this.** Especially if you're new, I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market. This applies to all stock, not just GME. If you're experienced, it might just sound like I'm explaining at length why 2 + 2 = 4, but since a friend of a friend told me he paper-handed on GME (sold the dip), I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea.  **I would encourage people to buy GME, but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while.** (edit: in addition, just to reiterate, keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down) By this I mean **NEVER SELL AT A LOSS**. Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down. All newbie investors (IMO) should adhere to this rule just in general. Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground, or don’t buy it at all.  Many investors, myself included, follow this rule religiously, not just with GME but with all stocks. I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss, I just held or bought more. COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out? I just held and was fine... should have bought more. If everyone bought into GME with this mindset, I bet it would go to Pluto easily.  If you sell at a loss, you are donating to the ""save the short sellers"" fund out of your own wallet, fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes, and you’re not even following sound investment practice. Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy. If you’re thinking of investing so much that you’ll wuss out, poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red... just don’t. Emotion and the stock market do not mix well.  Stop losses (below purchase price) are also for pansies and genuine idiots. “I’ll sell you some stock... but only if you give me a bad enough price on it.” Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down... if you feel like you need a stop loss, you're investing more than you should. Instead of being stupid, maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips.  Side note: personally, in the case of GME, I don’t have any limit sells either. From what I can tell on past short squeezes, the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down. So as long as you keep an eye on GME when it actually does skyrocket, you should have plenty of time. Set price alerts and relax. No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid-launch.  Although, if you want you can try to profit off GME volatility. Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I'm not sure they deserve it. As far as I know, buying low and selling high doesn’t really help HFs, it drives the price up (just not as much as buying and holding). But personally, my philosophy is, I can take baby profits anytime... who knows when something like this GME rise will happen again. So I’m holding (101 shares at cost average $106/share).  Want to get into the game now? You could always just buy a few shares, and keep the rest of what you’re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip. And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more, bringing your cost average down. Ideally, you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero. Always try to keep cash in reserve.  Locked yourself in at a high price? That's why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down. Didn't keep any cash in reserve? Guess you're stuck waiting for one of three things: 1) the short squeeze which will likely (though not certainly) happen, 2) for the price of GME to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases, or 3) you get your hands on some more cash you're willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down. **DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS** and you will never lose (edit: well, seldom, if ever. Unless the company goes bankrupt, a rare occurrence. This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket, and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero, it won't swallow your portfolio. Also, if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something, you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson). Hedge funds and billionaires know this, that's why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic. They bought the dip while regular folks paper-handed and got even poorer.  One more little trick. If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares, then even if your position goes “underwater,” you can always sell calls at above your average cost, bring DOWN your cost basis, and make money off your stock “risk free” while still following the rule of never sell at a loss. Although if you did it right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze. Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen, and you'll need to be patient and, like I said before, say goodbye to your money for a while.  **EDIT:** Just to reiterate, there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies. Trade however you want, just don’t paper hand GME. I would also note that you *can* sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule, if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price. It still follows the rule of ""don't sell at a loss."" Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100, doesn't matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier. You can even (slowly) take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5%, and sell one when it goes up 5%.  **EDIT:** Yes I know about opportunity cost. It does apply if you know something the general public doesn’t (rare if you’re just a low IQ ape but GME was/is an exception). Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn't, it could be a coin flip whether you'll hit rock bottom. In an ideal world, you can keep some money in reserve so you don’t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities. Yes I know about (and agree with) the sunk cost fallacy. My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal, lowering the cost basis, not “doubling down” on sunk cost.  Tl;dr 🦍buy 🍌, don’t give 🐍 🍌 unless 🐍 give more than 🦍pay for 🍌  Not financial advice. I am literally a zoo ape that somebody dropped their phone into the enclosure of. Sound advice. When you sell, you own nothing, you have no claim from that point on. When you hold, you at least still own something and you have a claim, what potential that yields is hard to say at times but it's more than nothing. Think of a store that has inventory sitting on the shelf for what is determined to suddenly be too long. Do they just toss it into the dumpster and take a total loss? They shouldn't, someone would pay something for it. So selling at a loss is certainly better than a total loss, but in the world of stonks how would they go into the dumpster? If they do, the least of your worries should be about losing all your money but instead how did you convince yourself to buy in the first place. But what factor does this point have which changes things? Time. This is why suddenly a store decides, shelf space could be better used, space (volume) and time. They think a different product on the shelf will perform better with the shelf space over the same or less amount of time. But what if they could simply take a loss on a little of the shitty product and use the remaining shelf space towards a little of the new product? Space and time equilibrium. You don't have to dump everything if you only need a little space with the same amount of time to make up. Time is everything because you're dying and only have so much left but volume is important too.     From a hypothetical point, I would expect something like GME to spike about every month. Why? People get paid, monthly debts are settled. Now, I can't say for sure that GME will trend like most stocks where the highs just diminish over time, but people are losing on it, no doubt about that, each and every time that happens it removes potential capital which could go into that stock in the next buy frenzy. Then there's the subjective aspect, people don't like the unpredictable when it starts to really hurt, so they avoid, at the same time people inherently understand, nothing lasts forever, so they avoid. Either way, the spikes get smaller and smaller each month.     The last spike only produced about 280% compared to the \~2100% in Jan. I can capture that in 56 days of regular trading with a lot less risk. True I might be able to shave off a lot of time IF I max out the margin on GME and IF I was right about it and with much less equity. OR, I could just continue at 5% daily gains which I get. Something I see people not considering is a fixed amount they need by the end of the \~250 trading days, a real amount. I know what I want to make and only make in that year. Getting to the moon is not priority, priority is a real number I'm going to put on my returns every year. Everything changes once that is factored in. The way I look at charts, I'm not just interested in how deep or how high, I'm really interested in what is the absolute longest time in a dip, what is the average time in a gain. And if I can't determine that because there is so much noise, it's excluded. There's volatility which I like, I actually need to meet that daily average and then there's just pure chaos. That determines what I do with that stock. So far, since the early 90's, I've been doing well, very well considering and I started as simply selecting with what was essentially someone else's money because I was too young. I've known success, $100K (which started as $10K) in Apple in 2006 because someone bought me an iPod for my birthday, something I knew absolutely nothing about and it encouraged me to research. But I really like pattern trading. So in college I started.     With GME I would do this, wait until the third week of the month, buy with a limit that I think would give me a 20% gain and that's it, then back to sanity, if the limit fails to execute, I didn't want it anyways so don't care. Yeah, it really only would give me 4 days of trading that I can completely fuck up on, but that's 4 days, I'll take it. Don't get greedy, that's what fucks people, they get greedy and the best way to let greed destroy your returns is not determining what you need to earn before you buy as opposed to what you want to earn. Well fuck, I want ACMR to trade at Tesla prices, ok, that's not going to happen by then end of the year. There's absolutely nothing out there to suggest this (unless someone out here knows something I don't) LOL     Know how much you need at the end of a day, a month, a quarter and a year and use that to determine whether you stay in or out after you've already determined that the stock is reliable which is why you shouldn't have to worry about selling. IF at the end of a years trading you have more than expected, then you can dump it on shit like GME, it's bonus money if you want to see it that way because it was unexpected, but when you come up short the next year suddenly that money won't be looked at as a bonus anymore. If you are never able to view additional earnings as a bonus (which you won't be able to if you didn't establish a necessary end amount to begin with), stay away from things that are unpredictable, that the universe says, this would be a complete anomaly and is unnatural and you will never have to sell at a loss because it will never stay as a permanent loss.     That being said....I have about $85K tied up into complete bullshit stocks right now....just waiting and no, I will never, ever sell until they at least start to break even several times and I've found something which will produce as well or better. I'm stubborn that way but that's the bonus money I really don't give a shit about. My seed has been out for about a month because I saw this coming. Some would say, no, this is the time to buy everything, no it's not because I haven't seen even a -4 on the Great Oscillator which is to be obeyed, period. We're getting there though. So instead of putting yourself in a position of not selling, try putting yourself in a position of not buying in the first place. Stop caring about missing opportunities that are only regretful with hindsight and start realizing dips are forever, they're infinite and you only need a few every now and then. Different ways of looking at things. I would rather miss a golden opportunity than to be denied the ability to trade when I want even if that meant I have puny returns in comparison. Reliability first and foremost, then Hail Mary's and if you can never part with your earnings, that's ok too.     As for sticking it to the man, I remember watching the floor getting cleaned up on Wednesdays on the boob tube and the movies sucked me in when I was a kid. Hedges et al will always be around, they will survive, it's all they do, I don't care if they get wealthier, I care about me getting wealthier cause I know way, way too many people rely on those guys....they're fucking impervious. But I sort of want them that way, I need more money in the market, last thing I want to do is reduce it, that would be like hoping everyone gets fucked so I can pick up stocks at the lowest prices in history because nobody has any money to buy them so they're worthless. Why the fuck would I want that? I say manipulate all you want, retail, hedge, who cares because at the end of the day, if you can't read the fine lines in the bullshit, you shouldn't be trading. That being said, let's all watch WKHS either destroy Wood or turn her into an oracle, like there hasn't been hundreds of those before right? Like they lose one contract and suddenly they might as well have never produced anything to this point!? So stupid. Never sell at a loss, k, never buy at a loss, never sell at a gain, never buy at a gain or DD and you don't have to worry about nevers. Big difference between a ""loss"" perceived and a loss achieved; sense of time, patience and calm and knowing where you wanted to be in the first place and did you have a plan and how much error is acceptable in the plan. That's as good as it gets. Now get out there you retards and start buying the shit out of ACMR...kidding, don't I need the price to be logical. LMAO GME is a special case of “opportunity cost.” Most of the time, low IQ apes like us wouldn’t know an opportunity from a pile of gorilla shit... let alone identify one before the general public does. But GME is something the general public is slow to come around to, because the media is trying to sweep it under the rug. So, welcome aboard the apemobile.  I wouldn’t put all my eggs in one basket, and I’d keep money in reserve in case you need to buy, but you do you. GME Megathread Part 2 for Friday, February 26th, 2021 A video I did when GME first dropped BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon.  HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK. Holding my measly 2.69 shares but holding none the less.   If AMC takes off then I’ll gladly buy 20-30 more GME. That’s autistic (and not in a good way), they’re gonna rise with GME so you’ll get burned like the HFs That guy who puts his limit sell at 28,888 as a fuck you but also hoping to catch an accidental sale when a short is covered during a squeeze. The person or HF being shorted HAS to cover their position right away and may do a market order because they need ANY shares immediately. So depending on how many they need and how many available, the shares gobbled up are gonna be of ascending prices. Stocks with low liquidity where the shares are tied up already move in relatively large spreads.  So a snipe is like a booby trap. You put a high limit sell order on a high volatility stock hoping for some dick hedge to market order cover their short and force them to buy your order. During the first GME event people got some good ones for 5k and more.   This may also be a fuck you to HF reading level 2 saying “I ain’t selling til here”. My brain can’t compute any of this. Buy GME? I got into GME in December, I sold some of it in the big Jan runup and some more of it last week.  This is what I am doing as I bank tendies from GME. I mean... read OP’s post. They ended up bag holding from January and their lives were severely affected. Now in round 2 instead of recuperating losses or hedging or taking profits she decides to YOLO all in again.   Memes aside, yeah I’d dump her dumbass too. If bag holding GME impacts your life it means you way overextended. Not learning your lesson and to do it again? Yikes. Not a single doubt that had trading not been stopped in January it would’ve been 700+ by open Friday morning. It WOULD have cleared 1k. I don’t think 10k was feasible, 5k maybe.  Agreed there is a MASSIVE sweet spot at the 500 range due to gamma, I’m really not sure if at this point it’ll clear $1,500. GME is (like another post mentioned) is a meme, it’s running its own course and impossible to predict. It’s classic moving the goal post.   I have GME shares and believe it will squeeze but I am under no hypnosis that GME is a perfect business model as it stands now. Right now, it is everything and nothing all at once. That is to say it’s just potential. For all the new GME investors who might be slightly confused about why and how the hedge funds have gotten themselves backed into this corner..  Melvin and friends thought that GameStop was a failing company, so they decided to short it's stock. They got so greedy, they decided that they would short the company by more stock than actually existed (naked short selling),  such was their confidence that GameStop was worthless.  The very act of doing this, if it hadn't been discovered might very well have driven Gamestop into bankruptcy, with the company still being viable.  When a company goes bankrupt, the short sellers don't haver to buy back or return the stock, so if GameStop had been driven into bankruptcy, this dirty illegal tactic they used might never have been exposed. By not having to buy the stock back, they make maximum profit on their short trade, and don't even have to pay any taxes on their profits. This is a short sellers wet dream.  Tens of thousands of people lose their jobs, homes get repossessed, suicides increase, families devastated, all while Melvin and his buddies eat caviar, sip champagne on balconies and count their ill gotten gains. It really is the devil's work what they do.  But now that the hedgie's devious ways have been exposed and shared with apes allover the world, Melvin and his friends can never drive GameStop into the ground, so they will be forced to buy back the shares at some stage. And because they were so greedy by naked short selling, now they have to buy back more shares than actually exist. They sold fake counterfeit shares, but they need to buy back real shares, the shares we own.  So even if you only hold 1 share, they need it. They need to buy every single share that actually exists to cover their position. And that is why 1 share of GameStop is worth whatever price you're willing to sell for, even if it's $500k and above.  For the last few weeks, Melvin and friends have been using even dirtier tactics, trying to fool us all into thinking that they do not need our shares.  Do not fall for this. They will use every psychological tactic they can to convince you to sell. Manipulating the price, turning off the buy button via RobinHood, paying media to say they have already covered etc. They are going to be using even dirtier tactics over the coming weeks,  some that we haven't event thought of yet.  All we need to do is hold ; nothing else, and get on with life.  &#x200B;  As an Irish Ape, I will finish by sharing an Irish patriotic saying..  ""*Tiocfaidh Ar La - Our Day will Come""* I'll buy a shit ton of RAD if you guys let me hitch a ride on the GME 🚀 and get my portfolio out of red baboon butthole territory. That was such fucking bullshit too. For months the deal was entirely predicated on it passing a review board with 2 votes which had 4 members, 2 of which were Republican and had a history of letting it go through. If it passed you get 100% gain, denial leads to 50-80% loss.  Then a week before Walgreens buys only half the stores from Rite Aid. Literally a black swan event in my eyes. Complete. Fucking. Bullshit.  Prepared me for the GME Robin Hood bullshit though. You can think you have all the data and you’re on the right side of a trade but there’s always some nonsense that comes up. I wish more of the GME new people knew this.  Was what happened fair? No.  Was everyone with millions of dollars of skin in the game just going to let GME hit $6969? No. If GME hits over $250 by next Friday I will get WSB logo tattoo as a tramp stamp. Oof. This is tough. I definitely think GME could see a spike this week but literally nobody knows. If I were you I’d roll 2 of them out to March 19. It’s brutal but your $21 premium can buy $210 calls. I’d personally rather own 3/19 $210 calls than $3/5 $120 calls (subject to nothing crazy happening Monday pre open).  Vol’s so high and the addition of time means the delta is almost the same. Tiger King went hard on GME GME Short Fee Up 1500%! Yesterday (2/25) GME had ZERO shortable shares available according to both [shortableshares.com](https: shortableshares.com) and IBorrowDesk. (Technically 47 shares reported prior to market open on shortableshares - IBorrowDesk did not report any shares the entire day).  Since then the volume of shortable shares has increased to 600,000 BUT the fee to short these shares has increased from 0.8% on 2/24 to a whopping 12.78% as of 10:00am today representing a nearly 1,500% increase.  Now, my smooth brain doesn't fully comprehend all the implications of this. But to me, this looks like a clear bullish sign for another GME runup, no?

Buying dips and selling peaks is optimal trading strategy, but who is buying GME because optimal trading strategy? I’d lose my ticket to the moon :c 300k IN SHARES. ANOTHER 10k IN FDS. GME GANG 💎👐😎 Love this shit. I'm a newbie, Bought 600usd on GME and AMC on Thursday, it's not much but it's all I can do right now. to the moon apes! I rather lose it all than sell and help the hedgies!!! I believe in going with GME you become a retard, we all know we're going to feel shitty when we see the next dip only to premature nut at the next high and shrivel again. People don't seem to fully appreciate HOW many options are VERY CLOSE to being in the money expiring today. As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will. Remember each 1 option = 100 shares.

Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.  This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).  It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.  There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.  AMC has A LOT MORE: [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.  BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.  NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.  Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).  Everyone have a great weekend.  Disclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only. Do your own research. Not financial advice. Eat crayons.     EDIT 2: fucked formatting We are having a special all inclusive trips to Mars just buy some GME and buckle up!!! You had me at LMND. Will be looking into them once GME squeezes. Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date! Charity, savings and reinvesting aside, what are you excited to do for yourself when you hit it big in GME? What are you excited to do for your immediate family and friends?   Personally, I only have a handful of shares and calls, but with my potential winnings:  *Downpayment on a house in this expensive ass west coast market  *Aquire that sweet, sweet Tesla  *Take a year or so off work, hit the road and travel again for awhile   *Help out my parents a bit  *Order all of the dumb shit from my Amazon wish lists that I’ve always wanted but could never justify spending money on Buy some land (for a house next year), get a dog, reinvest in GME for long term. Set some aside some cash for if my car shits the bed next year. And most importantly, setting aside taxes so Uncle Sam doesn’t get mad. Pay off student loan debt and remodel my kitchen to make up for how much my wife has to hear about GME. GME Megathread for Friday, February 26th, 2021 There's a split in this community between the GME Apes and other traders. Duh, not sure how people didn’t see this. Ohh wait I do, hating RobinHood is a meme. Looks like there’s gonna be a new bidding war.... It’s gonna make GME look like a firecracker. Force multiplication. Of course if it came public that Vlad cancelled outstanding sell orders and replaced them with RobinHood’s millions of fractional shares to pocket the squeeze for himself? That would be bad press, you know? Could change how people perceive the value of the company a bit, don’t you think? We all saw the screenshots popping up on people’s phones, I wish I saved them.   Pretty sleazy. But now that’s force amplification money. Your account is watched, monitored, and analyzed to tell how good you are, and order flow as alternate data makes it work. I’ve made a lot of money so far using it because when I started I got insanely lucky and doubled up on my first trade of my life. Well, the first was actually the free one. I did my DD and sold as soon as it vested, and then the stock crashed 20%. Basically the machine thinks I’m really good, so it bets with me. Ever see buying a couple dollars worth of low float and then orders start rolling in?  Call me crazy but that really seems how it works, the power my “score” has on the market maker liquidity algorithms, which the broker may provide as order flow records as alternate data. Everything is all well and good as long as you don’t get front-runned, and I think that may be happening what with Citadel’s interference.   Of course they may be routing that through to their butt boy Melvin, and that’s what Cramer was referencing when he wanted to call fraud on the whole thing the other day.... See where it all leads now?  The end game for GME is quite simple: the stock has a cumulative pressure to increase as shorting does not close. What happens when institutional investors on paper own more than 100% of the company, by force of law? And if they don’t sell? They use the remainder to set a price which must be bought. At that point whatever is out there, which will probably not be many, gets absurd amount of amplified pressure to move prices at the inverse of liquidity.   Liquidity freezing will lead to hyperinflation cascade in price, which is what we saw last time. If you are front run, you are at extreme disadvantage. That’s how we got ripped off... in a peanut shell🥜  How’s that for crazy? I wasn't calling you in particular poor. I'm referring to the retail trader in general. As you probably know, it's rare for retail trader to be allowed to take short positions. Plus, I'm sure even the GME apes have figured out what a put option is by now. Congratulations on your two buildings. I converted the price of GME to sound and could not believe my ears $GME   From Barrons:  “It appears Harvey suspects some of the GameStop volatility isn’t due to a short squeeze or aggressive trading, but partly a function of small-cap portfolio managers weighing their options. Managers trying to recapture performance before reconstitution could be driving the stock. That means there could be some more wild trading between now and Russell index reconstitution. “  https: www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-stock-volatility-could-get-even-worse-heres-why-51614360082  HODL what I have, buying more when I can  I really like the stock, have no clue what I am talking about, although I know I have no paws  Stay safe en enjoy the ride Got the band back in the studio and recorded another GME-Led Zeppelin cover. I call it Dy’mond Hand’er. BB 30$ EOY. Everyone who got left bagholding during the first GME run will be in tendie land by january next year. take a look at the stock every month or so and you'll be good. You know what it takes to hold GME and AMC? Anyone feeling the stressed about GME see these charts &#x200B;  [This is GME. This is your rocket ship. Its currently fueling up.](https: preview.redd.it/qfw3u6q2qvj61.png?width=3060&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3cd4bcec168e8a068a8de56d40633cb1de77c74)  This is a chart for GME, the price has been adjusted to scale logarithmically to make the trend easier to see and enable us to see all the data points at once. For all you apes out there all that means is the higher you go, the faster you go higher. This trend started in August. It will likely continue as long as Ryan Cohen and the folks he brought over do good work. Now lets address those large spikes.  &#x200B;  [January Ape welcoming party, no despair here.](https: preview.redd.it/x7vxju4trvj61.png?width=3057&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed649938b25bcb7e461ba4ec794d56bbe72fa33)  See this, its a classic example of a textbook speculation bubble (dont panic just breathe and read, if you're having trouble go ask your wifes bf to read it out loud for you.)  [See](https: preview.redd.it/syvpt1m4tvj61.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e65377fc7cfcbd212a6ff8ca714ca330fedf02e)  So a speculation bubble occurred, but why? What caused it and what does that mean going forward? Especially with the recent activity yesterday and today.  Firstly I am not a financial advisor, and I don't give financial advice.  Secondly to answer is pretty simple this was caused by millions of apes rushing to the stock market to buy GME duh. News goes viral about the squeeze the apes buy, paper hands sell. Ok but that sounds really bad right? Again not necessarily. Bubbles like this happen all the time on all just about anything that can be traded over time scales ranging from a few hours to a few months. One of the things that makes GME such unique opportunity is that there is an incredibly tiny number of available shares relative to its market cap. This important for the squeze but it also means the price is more susceptible to dramatic price fluctuations. In fact it is this property that make a squeeze possible, its the nitrous in your gas that turns it into rocket fuel. Imagine you and all your neighbors are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and everyday you get 10 gallons of water to share between you that no big deal but what happens when 10 gallons turns to 9 then 8 then 7 and so on. the less water (available shares) the more volatile you and your neighbors get until eventually everything goes MAD MAX and you have all the water to yourself.  so the speculation boils down to....is this the Squeeze? did it squouze? am i too late? So what does that mean for the apes that boarded at 200 250 400. Well nothing the Price is going to jump around a lot and every time it should settle a little bit higher than before, all the while costing the shorts more and more interest, until the squeeze goes off or the market value has reached your cost basis and you're wishing you bought more dip so you could have averaged down and made a profit by now.  Additionally if you assume the price jump was in fact speculative bubble it means the shorts couldn't really have covered without guaranteeing rocket launch. those arrogant entitled assholes would have had to look in the mirror admit they lost and launch the rocket themselves. OR they could lie to you, and double down. Historically they double down because its not their personal money and the hate being wrong almost as much as they hate losing money  Personally I don't think the shorts will ever capitulate on their own. I think that it will end in one of 3 ways.  1 SEC will turn up some smoking gun of some kind in an investigation that cant be swept away, and a scapegoat will be offered to the public  2 their clearing house will call their the short positions in and they'll go belly up  3 the shorts are right and we're either too dumb or too distracted to out last them  Just to be clear these are all short term endings. The long term end is basically Cohen and Friends save GAMESTOP and turn it into a digital platform powerhouse, or they don't. They got a pretty good track record though. I mean Chewy sells pet food and toys and its valued at nearly 6 times what GAMESTOP is, don't get me wrong I love my dogs but I spend way more on video games each year than I do on pet food and supplies, and I don't think I'm the only one.  OK, so that covers Jan but what about today and yesterday. Well yeah short answer is I'm not sure, but my best guess is that as a result of some options trading practices someone had to buy a bunch of shares to hedge those options and because the available supply is being restricted by all you apes the price reacted extra sensitively kicking off even more hype. This would be a good sign as it means that the fuel mixture (volatility) is getting super powered and just waiting for the right ignition (catalyst.)  &#x200B;  [Just so you know I where I stand](https: preview.redd.it/bnps5z3z8wj61.png?width=2409&format=png&auto=webp&s=84d2dc21952c6ff352955f0bb9a2c67035185815)  TL;DR I like the stock. Diamond hands, buy the dip  Edit: Obligatory emojis          💎💎💎👋👋👋🚀🚀🚀  Edit 2: my first awards. Yay. PLTR is for scrubs.  GME is for thugs. So for all my fellow apes who recently joined and may be unsure exactly what a short squeeze is...  1. We own shares that Melvin and friends need to buy at some stage from us to cover their short positions. 2. They were naked short selling, which means they got extra greedy, sold shares that didn't even exist,  and wanted to bankrupt Gamestop. if they had succeeded in bankrupting Gamestop, they would never have had to buy back the shares to cover their shorts and their illegal short selling would never have been known. 3. Apes discovered this and told other apes, so before Melvin could bankrupt Gamestop, all the apes started buying GME stock to thwart Melvin's evil plan. 4. Now that Gamestop has been saved, Melvin will have to buy back the shares they shorted. And its a lot. 5. They must buy the shares from us, and we can offer it to them for whatever price we like. 6. Because we will want so much money from then for each share, they're gonna be forced to sell everything they own to pay for it. This includes all the other shares they own. 7. The market knows this might happen, so everyone starts selling shares in other companies, either to be out of the market for the upcoming turmoil, or to buy GME shares. 8. Eventually the entire market can fall massively, except GME. 9. This is the squeeze. The value of the entire market gets squeezed into 1 stock. GME. Imagine the stock market is an orange being squeezed into a glass. GME is the glass. 10. GME holders now have massive profits, and go buy up all the other shares for cheap in the stock market. We are the new 1%, but because we know what life is like on the bottom, we will be generous with our profits. When the squeeze is done, the world will be a better place. So, as a newly born ape, my question is whether or not there's a ceiling to the price of GME.   I understand that they have to buy the stock at some point (is there a set date for when their shorts are due back?) but do we apes currently own the same amount of stocks or more than the hedge funds need?   And why is there still stock left to buy, shouldn't the hedgies have bought it all up by now to try and cover their butts, leaving us at the predicted stalemate already?   Maybe I'm just not eating the right crayons yet, trying hard though!

I thought I was good, but turns out I'm merely a fucking retarded ape with a beautiful law diploma hanging on the wall of my corporate office. Fuck me.   Even if shit hits the fan for us and we lose everything (we wont.), shit that been one hell of a ride. We've learned shit that takes years to learn in two months. You cant learn about all the fuckery possible in books, apes. You gotta live it. It's a fucking rotten system.   Dunno why I'm posting. Just want to be part of a community of beautiful retarded and wide-assed apes that works to destroy what my job represents, because I fucking hate it. Love you all.   Positions: 100 GME @ 102, back in late january **TL;DR RKT is going to bull run all the way to the 9th March after its beautiful earnings and it's time to burn some shorts.**  Yesterday pre-earnings I posted some [DD](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsdpuz/rkt_to_the_moon_dd_and_short_squeeze_opportunity/) on why RKT (Rocket Companies) was a buy. I was right, the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10% from highs of a 20% gain during the day. To someone that has not followed RKT this may seem like a missed opportunity. WRONG. Welcome to the Amazon of the Finance World (well near enough).  Rocket by all traditional measures should've risen to $25 (previous close of $19.90) minimum today. Their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past. Practically since the IPO institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls, some covered, some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between $19 and $21 or to average down from a bag holding position above. These players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase (a potential gamma squeeze if it did so). Hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below $22.  **Next week, things start to change...**  But before that let's just go over the insane earnings they just report:  1. **EPS $1.09** (analyst prediction $0.87) an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from $754 million to $2.84 billion. 2. A **special dividend of $1.11** per share to Class A common stock holders on March 9th (note this is important autists). 3. **Partnerships with a multitude of companies including JP Morgan**. 4. Stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended. 5. There's more little nuggets but that's enough for ape brain to take in.  **So what happens next week?**  Firstly the dividend at current stock price is just over **5% yield**. An insane amount. This provides a catalyst for the price in two ways. Firstly, who doesn't want any easy 5% return? This is hardly priced in let's be realistic. These earnings give RKT as **PE of 5**. Way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around **3 to 4 times too small** if you consider them a Fintech.  More importantly, let's have a look at RKT's **short interest**. It lies somewhere between 35% and 40%. Now let's be clear this isn't going to be a Reddit, retail investor driven **short squeeze**, RKT has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million BUT if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure. Shorts have to pay the dividend - an instant 5% loss is not a good look and who knows if there'll be more to come in later earnings. With call holders less in the equation, the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies. It's time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the IPO.  Everyone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover, and 40% of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me. A huge difference between RKT and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above $30 indefinitely (or higher). Shorts don't like to be stuck indefinitely losing, unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse - not that they will unless you all have weak hands. Expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around $30+ to drive the price up more.  With all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of March. I have a genuine PT after that earnings of $40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ship's favour the moon is only the beginning. This Rocket is going up Uranus like your wife's boyfriend's is up hers.  Rocket is recruiting diamond hands, I am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10% profit BUT autists and apes we can get 100%, 200% or more!  RKT closed at $21.85 today. It is my firm believe RKT is a **brilliant buy** after these earnings under $24 and if the bull run starts all the way to $30. Management want these shorts out and that's good enough for me, the CEO laughed at the shorts on CNBC.  I am willing to put my money where my mouth is as I averaged up from $30 per cent equivalent CfD contracts at $20.30 to $41 per cent equivalent at $20.91.  In other words get us to $46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade. These values are actually GBP but I presumed you only know dollar due to autism.  **I just like the stock. So buy shares, squeeze shorts.**  **RKT TO THE MOON!**  [Earnings Call Transcript](https: www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/)  EDIT: VERY IMPORTANT POINT - some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95% is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion not far off GME. Just more reason to buy  Disclaimer: This is not financial advise and should not be taken as such. (SEC scares me)  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/t4b0ga009wj61.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=988cbd4e0b73580ab34b8bdd4fbe20efac64b9af No margin here papa all cash 💰!!!! But very good point! But I don’t think GME is available for margin anymore. Day 3 update. To be honest I’m feeling very confident for next week. LETS FUCKING GET IT. GME TO 1000 I don’t support Robinhood bud. This GME shit that’s going on is a once in a lifetime situation and I’m not going to miss out on the next squeeze switching apps Loading up Monday on SPCE and GME. GME might not make me that many tendies (late to the game) but SPCE sure will. LFG GME $6600 to $35000. Thank you DFV! Insufficient, non-evidence based GME DD After pouring through far more data than I really should be consuming on GME, I came to a few conclusions. I'll present my hypothesis first and let you all tear it to shreds:     1. There won't be a squeeze until HFs are appropriately re-positioned from short to long, and won't just recover but profit.  2. All of the (expensive) machinations witnessed thus far, such as naked shorting, trade halts, naked calls, etc. are only stalling for time allowing HFs to reposition. 3. When the squeeze happens, the narrative will be played in the press as ""retail beating wall street,"" when the reality is more like ""HFs and MMs illegally manipulated the market so they could blatantly steal money from issuing naked calls, and then after that game went stale they allowed the squeeze to make them trillionaires.""  4. There's a chance the squeeze won't happen at all, and the HFs will continue to circle-jerk retail around, bleeding us for money on naked calls and dangling the dream of the moon in front of us. I didn't think it was possible to manipulate the price so effectively with no shares, but HFs have educated me on their antics.      I'm evenly split on whether I actually think the squeeze will happen at this point, or whether HFs/MMs (citadelvin) will profit sufficiently from selling naked calls to keep the game alive. I don't have reliable data on how many calls Shitadel is selling per day; the best clarity I could get was this obscure figure saying that Shitadel does more volume than the NYSE. Without a Bloomberg terminal, I don't think I can find data more specific to GME calls sold daily. My estimate and my suspicion is that Shitadel is making at least enough money selling naked calls to finance melvin short selling activity, and probably more than that.      Any newbies on this sub who invested for social justice reasons, please either buckle up or strongly re-examine your motivations for investing. You can make tons of profit in the market and do great good with your earnings. But don't fool yourself that you'll ""stick it"" to any HF who has, by now, already hedged the other side of a bad bet. If you stick with GME and win, take your earnings and make the world a better place. Or buy a Tesla. It's all the same to us, really. We're here for the sweet tendies.   &#x200B;  Pattern recognition is my superpower, so it's taken me a little time to observe the process and see how things panned out. GME price didn't break out on Wednesday because of anything related to Fed liquidity, it was allowed to peak in order to drive up interest and call prices. This is the real play. Don't get played. The secondary value in allowing GME to peak is that it creates a sense of FOMO now in people who didn't sell. Even knowing this was a psychology play, I was surprised at how fast my animal brain jumped in saying ""but wait oooh shiney profits."" Do NOT underestimate how fast the paperhands FOMO will kick in when we hit $400 again. The HFs really have a handle on price manipulation, which should be illegal AF. But here we are.      TL:DR:  Calls have turned into pump and dump and the primary profit goes to Shitadelvin. If you're new to options trading, definitely avoid. It must have been shit! GME all the way up, can’t stop and won’t stop buying and holding! It’s been pretty sad watching newtards upvoting any non-evidence based GME hopium posts thinking they’re true. It’s like watching sheep following each other to the slaughterhouse.  As a passive observer, I for one am stoked to watch this shit show have people all in on $ROPE at the end. > Insufficient, non-evidence based GME DD  So the opposite of DD. Yeah I’ve been thinking this too. As much as I want the little guys to win, they simply can’t. The hedge funds are making a killing off this right now. They’re using the IV to sell the calls that get crushed. Think about all the GME loss porn you saw this weekend. All those 0dte 200C that got demolished? Someone sold you those.   Fuck the hedge funds. But use your head. Use logic, not emotions when trading. And I know it sucks to say but there is no “we” in trading. It’s not a multiplayer game. You need to focus on your own portfolio and not worry about others. I’ve been long GME since $14 and still believe in the company long term. The chances of us seeing $300+ again is slim though. GME simply doesn’t have the potential for upwards momentum through buying pressure like we saw last time. It also has huge walls it needs to break down. Beacause if you had talk with your husband’s girlfriend she would have told you that the market manipulation is making $GME hiper volatile and the 100$ floor during the highest volume in weeks tell’s something you’re letting pass. PS: Not financial advice, just a retard that have 5 @45 and 2 @88 by selling and rebuying profits. Chances of seeing $300 again are almost %100 given a year or so time.  Unless Ryan Cohen and friends absolutely shit he bed $300 is an absolute low. Compare Gaming as a whole to pet supplies as a whole. Now compare Chewy’s market cap with GME’s.  Now laugh with me about how silly it is to think that GameStop isn’t worth at LEAST $300/share. This would be a other good WSB target... high short interest in an industry boomers know nothing about (esports and gaming live-streaming) that we all know is going to keep growing like crazy. Frankly, much better prospects for HUYA than GME.  Edit: they are like the Twitch and Discord of China, who has 4x as many gamers as the US... their market cap is about the same as GME but they have positive earnings. Best gain of the year for me. flipped this to buy and hold more shares for GME and AMC I bought $800 GME calls this morning that expire on March 12th. Am I winning yet?

Exactly 4 out of the 160 comments agreed with me.    I still think GME is a terrible investment. Ryan Cohen’s last company CHWY [has yet to turn a profit.](https: www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/chwy/earnings). Maybe you apes are right and he’s a Business Jesus, but I invest based on numbers not on personality cults, and I haven’t seen any impressive numbers yet that would convince me to buy and hold GME. I do see numbers now and then (like IV%) that convince me to trade short-term--so I still hope it hits $500, I just don’t think it will. My long-term price target is between $2 and $36. I’ll adjust that at the next earnings report (and you should adjust your targets then too).   #Results   Calling all apes who made the bet! There aren’t any trading days left in February. GME didn’t hit $500. You gotta read a book.   Thanks to everyone who was a good sport. A jolly ‘lol gg no re’ to everyone who wasn’t.

You guys were really convinced that you had some kind of social movement going (you didn’t, you just joined a p*mp n dump) and it felt bad to take advantage of your naivete.

Fellow retards, I might be retarded but I'm just thinking about the future of GME. Ryan Cohen and team turned Chewy into a company worth 40 Billion. Currently trading at 103 a share. Chewy does not have a ton of assets its just an online e-commerce pet store. He beat Amazon out to become the primary pet supply online retailer.  GME actually has real assets, stores all across the country. Imagine what he could do with that. GME 3.8B market cap is absolutely undervalued.  Ryan Cohen saw an opportunity with gamestop, to take a dying company and turn it around doing what he ALREADY KNOWS HOW TO DO.  In short, I like the stock. If I can make some money on a squeeze I'm happy - if somehow things don't work out with a squeeze I'm happy to hold. I'm looking at bringing my average down soon and holding unless this thing pops off to the 1000s.  DFV is a very smart man.

Feel like this info should be known, just  gets swamped in the mega thread.  Current open contracts with strike $5 to $100 is 51,470 contracts, if GME closes above $100 that’s 51,470 contacts In the money. If these were all exercised (highly unlikely next to impossible) that’s 5,147,000 shares that will have to be delivered.   There are currently 155,743 open call contracts between $5 and $200, if GME closes above $200 and all these calls are exercised (they won’t all be exercised), that’s 15,574,300 shares that would have to be delivered.  If this happens (which it won’t), I think the stock will go brrr.  Not financial advice.   This info can be found by googling open options chain.  Edit: The public float of shares is 45.05 million [source](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME), if we finish above $100 that’s over 10% of the current float in shares that could possibly be exercised by the call contracts.

GME HIGH OF $403 TODAY ACCORDING TO NASDAQ Bought back my GME $125 strike CC so that I don’t lose my 100 shares when we take off 🚀 On GME and index re-balancing. DD from behind a Wendy's. Alright, I know most of you can't read anything longer than a fortune cookie, so I'm putting this right up here at the top:  TL;DR -    1. GME market cap goes up   2. Index funds end up underweight GME   3. They must fix this before May/June, or losses are locked in   4. Tendies      So I was sucking on the Frosty machine at Wendy's when I decided to look into what it might mean for GME when it moves from the Russell 2000 (small cap) to the Russell 1000 (large cap) in May and June.  This typically doesn't mean much for a single stock, but with the volatility we've seen with GME already, as well as the percentage change in market cap, I think this may be more significant for GME than most companies.  FTSE Russell does a big giant rebanlacing that lasts about two months in May and June.  Link here for the 2020 schedule. [https: www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule](https: www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule) .  The 2021 dates aren't released yet but should be basically the same.  Because of the recent run-up in price on GME, it is set for a move from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000.  This same price increase also left many active fund managers underweight in GME, and they are losing out on recent gains.  All of this means Russell 2000 active fund managers who are underweight in GME right now, only have about 2-3 months to attempt to fix it before it gets taken out of the index, and their under performance on GME gets locked in.  It's quite possible that they are helping to form a large part of the floor, and their increasingly desperate attempts to not have the underweight GME locked in at re-balancing time will cause more and more volatility as the deadline approaches.   A recent comparison I would like to make is to TSLA, both because of its retail popularity, short interest, and volatility leading up to SP500 inclusion.  S&P announced that TSLA would be added to the index on Nov. 17, 2020, and it was officially added on Dec. 21. In that time, it's stock price went from $441 to $649, with an overall increase in market cap of over $200 billion dollars.  With a current market cap of around $5-10 Billion dollars depending on the day, it takes a lot less money to move the price on GME, and with the high likelihood of underweight Russell 2000 index funds, we may see even more volatility leading up May/June than we have so far this year.  &#x200B;  Disclosure - I am long GME.  This is not financial advice.  I used to work at Wendy's but was fired. GME to $1,000🚀 Buy GME & don't Sell Yeah... like Reddit can pump up a stock.

This is up from 37% yesterday! 💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/svzkwzl2bvj61.png?width=2784&format=png&auto=webp&s=f15a23bbfbae0e68c4445d32e7eee78e15d5a75d  [I have updated this DD to include Friday's data as well as some new data sources.

The last 4 days we have seen Short volume as a percent of total volume between 58-62%. During the last jump in price, we saw between 32-54%, so as a percent of daily volume, the shorts are even HIGHER than last time!  EDIT: Thank you u/RicFlairsCape \- correct about the volume being total volume, not total shorts. i have updated the formula, looking at total short volume executed. Agree we don't know if it is all new positions or not, but the volume increase of acted shorts is in line with what we saw last time.  My fellow apes!  boilerplate: i know nothing, i can't do math good. don't listen to me  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see a increase in short volume over the last 2 days! [http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html)  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user friendly document)  There was nearly 12 million in volume yesterday and 33 million in volume today! This is literally IDENTICAL to the volume we say on Jan 21 & 22 (11M & 33M) just before the price jumped. All the fights we have over politics and stuff at the end of the day, it's all very subjective and both sides will have their own views and it's hard to side with one side objectively over the other.   I missed the boat on GME but I've never been madder in my life.  When people fuck with your money directly like what all the brokers did (whether citadel had a hand in it or not), I can easily see our capitalist culture turning to the pitch forks.  Isn't this what we were taught all our lives in school? How superior our system is to communism and oligarchies because it's fair and open!  Bullshit. Saw news flash that Robinhood might be filing a secret IPO around March. [News flair section also have posts about it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltduq8/only_time_we_can_support/).   Was trying to game out what to do should Robinhood goes IPO and reasons for actions.  a. Short: talk about poetic justice. Robinhood screwed retail investors in the GME squeeze and it is time to squeeze back. Besides, there are ample footings for shorting Robinhood. The GME squeeze has exposed Robinhood's shady practices and it is under a lot of watchful eyes. To file such a hasty IPO when it has not cleared its name yet may be a sign that early investors are already nervous about its prospects and they are trying to capitalize and exit early.   b. Long: regardless of all the shortfalls, Robinhood has broadened stock trading to an unprecedented level in this market. It still has a strong, loyal and ever expanding user base, including many in this subreddit. Revenue shot up more than 500% in 2020; even after the pandemic ebbs the habit of trading with Robinhood won't die out.   c. Just a normal stock. Not Boomer's favorite value stock, but not tendies or stonk either. Just something out there in the market. Maybe a stock to park some idle money, but won't expect a YOLO gain/loss.   d. Don't even want to touch it. Like ex-wife or ex-husband, better be gone and stay gone.  What would you do? Probably Robinhood will ban shorting and puts of their own stock at their own platform. The whole GME squeeze all over again. GME Creyon graph chart $325 42c expired today and made me $6935 richer! Doubled down!! GME 🚀🔥 When you see GME green you know it's gonna take you to the moon 🚀🌑💎🙌 GME up 37% ""I'm not sure I can take it again"""
AMC,525,157244," AMC dudes are poor dudes who can’t afford GME Fkn hilarious, apes pumped so much money into AMC and the execs give themselves mad bonuses lol. I miss the DD’s posts and comments. Now it’s just “GME AMC 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀” AMC apes are the slightly more retarded and hunchbacked younger brothers of GME apes. Some ape just tried telling me AMC has great fundamentals. They’ve had a negative EPS for the last year. Some of these apes are going to get absolutely fucked. Hate selling at a loss but thinking about selling my BB to get more AMC or GME.  Thoughts? AMC hit 8.01 bro. That means I am GUARANTEED to see $20 a share and make a million dollars. It's science! Or biology or something. Curious to know if my AMC FD's have any return this week haha Looks like Monday menu is most awaited with AMC and GME are on top of the list 😅😅😅😅😅 AMC, AMC, AMC to the moon... Get this, my fellow apes. Tomorrow I have my exit exam for nursing school. I graduate literally in 17 days and this exit exam is the biggest exam of the entire program. But I’m salty that I can’t watch my GME and AMC all morning while I’m stuck in this exam???!!! Ass backwards priorities lol. When GME goes up AMC follows double squeeze please like my wife's boyfriend does to her!! AMC calls hmm.  We shall see how this goes yolo like 30k Is $AMC still a good choice? Or nah? Sorry im new 🤷🏽‍♂️ No, but I hear the AMC Superbowl starts tomorrow. plenty of entertainment at AMC after monday moon It’s called AMC Entertainment Holdings for a reason AMC is not a dead cat 🧑🏿‍🚀🚀 I'm pretty sure this is the highest level of DD that could possibly be offered on this sub. Selling the rest of my portfolio (besides AMC) and buying more Monday of course now. Thanks CAT! just freed up 10k to dump in thans! $AMC $GME #iamnotacat What does he/she/it/they/their/them say about AMC? 🚀🚀🚀 $AMC , $BB , $GME , $NOK 📯 buy...bUY...BUUUY!!! 💎🙌 [Operation AMC ](https: youtu.be/ZtyJy0FFCbs) Should also buy up some AMC, gonna be bigger than GME Waiting For That AMC Squeeze. So Many Call Options In The Money. 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑 Honestly the feedback here is awesome and I am trying to respond to as many people as I can haha! Great way to spend Sunday before market opens and I double down on some shares and calls!  I am genuinely interested to hear from all the naysayers though who don’t believe in the stock and I’m going to make a post for discussion so we can all see where these people are coming from!  Also, thank you so much for the support on my most successful post so far! I am glad so many of you are reaching out to me to learn more about how I am approaching this and how it’s possible to jump on this ship without losing money!   Of course these are my opinions and I’m only saying what I would do/have done to keep me in the green even when the stock tanked last week by utilizing options and not setting the expiration for February 28th...  Anyways, my goal is to educate. If you have a differing opinion please explain it instead of tearing people down so we can all learn and grow together!  Maybe I am a little naive and innocent to believe we are here to support one another and that we all want to prosper together... Maybe. BUT that won’t stop me from trying!  Will I make a post like this again?  Yes.   What if you get hate?  I’ll STILL EFF’NG DO IT AGAIN  There’s more positivity here than hate.   Special Thank you to those of you also answering peoples questions about the stock and how to get in! This is why the stock will surge again! If we teach people how to invest more wisely it will reduce the need to paper hand for %20-%200 and cash out options at 500%-1000%+ so they can buy more shares!  Maybe some don’t want this. I dunno. But I want to find out so we move forward again!  Also, yes I own both GME and AMC in shares and options and my options are worth more than my shares for anyone wondering and I’m BUYING MORE tomorrow! Or Friday when it dips again   Why did I make this comment long?  Sorry lol Once stimulus checks start hitting bank accounts combined with tax return season in motion a lot of that extra $$ that people aren’t used to having is of course going to help families that are struggling get by but for the people doing fairly well and still employed it is going to find its way right back into The market in one form or another especially on speculative stocks like AMC, GME, CRON, CGC etc. and everything else that a speculative investor can try and ante up on and make more money,  it’s like the casino giving out free chips to degenerate gamblers, and the so called Professional/ Career investors /HF Would argue that we don’t know what we’re doing or talking about and should not be putting money into stocks that do not make sense, I would argue what stock does make sense everything is speculation and nobody knows what the future of the company will be look at Tesla’s PE ratio most HF were dead wrong about that one and who are they to say AMC/GME Will not fully transform their business down the road With solid leader ship in place as we grow further into this digital age I think they’re just crying because the house is actually on the losing side of the trade and it’s just getting started good luck to all 🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍💎🙌🏻 PS This is not financial advice  my brain is so smooth that it resembles silly putty when it’s fresh out of the container I just like the stonks What are GME and AMC hitting next week?! Buy AMC and GME  HOLD BY SUMER TIME BOTH STONK  WILL 🚀🌝🦍💎✋🏼 I don't understand these 'limits"" being referred to. When I look at the stock on CashApp, I only see a buy or sell option. I'm finally able to access GME, but I don't know where it's been sitting since last week. Is the 100$ per share high or low rn? The app doesn't really show enough data and I don't want to buy it high. I have AMC, but that was a buy and hold long-term for me. I just bought AMC to learn the process. I got on the rocket when GME jumped up the 2nd time, bought 4 shares at 130$ and then another share at 100$   Also got 25 shares in AMC.  Just waiting for Monday, if it drops some more I’ll probably put in more.  So glad cashapp let gme and amc on there. What about AMC, will that behave like GME? They are both going to the moon. I’m invested in both and I’m waaaay up with them as well. GME is giving me higher returns but AMC is profitable as well with a lower buy in. I think this is also why it will moon too! AMC to Pluto Luckily I have AMC & GME too next to BB, so I can grab on to the rocket when it just leaves our atmosphere 🚀🚀🚀🦍💎🙌 Is this playing at AMC? AMC stock ad I was looking at the OTM call options and there are calls at $40 that expire on next Friday..... each call cost you $10 but the rewards if it goes up this week (which it will) is enormous... if you put $20 and the stock goes to $40 by Wednesday those $20 can become over $1,500..... if it goes higher you make more..... best part is that you can sell those at any prize if it’s higher then what it is now and make money if it goes lower then you only lost $20  I just noticed that this is a GME threat.... the calls I mentioned were for AMC, my bad 🤦‍♂️ I’ve been going back and forth seeing all the DDs I yolod 8.2k shares in AMC at under 5$ thinking long term wise amc will rebound to 15$ post pandemic ill just hold this for a year or two my father a giant tesla bull told me I’m a idiot for following the meme stocks .  Than I wakeup Thursday check my account for the first time this week out of curiosity +101%. So I did the logical thing. I got 1.8k shares more because 8.2k didn’t look as nice as a flat 10k. Pops said sell but I want gains not lunch money pa Go check out AMC aswell :)) we also need apes like you ""Yoloed my last $47.36 into AMC shares in with you apes for the cause. One of you now. Right? Right?? Please validate"" I'll be happy when my 2 shares of AMC are worth $20 a share. That was my last $15.

But also when we get to tendie town I'm gonna hit you up for cash. I was thinking of this on Friday over at AMC when I was scooping up shares under 7.97. I was like, ""go ahead, i WANT you to push it down, because now they're MINE. I. DRINK. YOUR. MILKSHAKE. I DRINK IT UP! BRILLIANT! Praying it's done in TRIPLICATE; GME, AMC, NOK. Bring us littles with you. We're fun too! 💎💖🙌😂💖💎 Sooon may the wellerman come, to bring us GME and BB'C' and AMC (hey) Wait for the AMC experience!! That’s why AMC is next 🙌 LOL, I just bought 40% of what i could buy, and now over the weekend I earned alot of tendies trading internet money, can't wait till monday to buy more of $GME and $AMC with my internet tendies.... TLDR they are fucked Mutual fund ownership of the GME stock is now closing on 4000%.  https: www.msn.com/en-us/money/stockdetails/ownership/fi-a1tyxm  AMC is at 3000%.  GME earnings is coming March 24th. This will be interesting. I don’t know how I’m feeling about AMC..... I let a $7 call for AMC go through. Now I’m H0DL 🦧. Had to borrow some cash but I know it’s gonna pay. 🚀🚀💎 Several points : - the first sudden drop in January was due to robinhood's shady (to say the least until it is not decided in justice) decision. This can't happen again as people have moved. - DFV's bluff calling showed us the situation is very dire for them last week. Before that many believed the situation was lost and it would never go up again. Now we have been proved it will. Radical change in outlook.  - it costs a lot of money for them to keep the price down. Interests + initial buying power. We're talking about hundreds of millions of interests every day in pure loss. And billions in investment that are going down the drain as long as the price rises.  - the bond yield interest put a massive blow in the economy last week. This means they lost massive amounts of money on other positions and are running out of cash. - stimulus checks and tax refunds are coming in and many apes are doubling down. We saw on Friday at the closing bell a tremendous pressure to try and keep the price down. They had to short dozens of millions of shares in a single day and still failed to achieve their goal of going under 100 dollars. This means two things : they are digging their grave deeper every day, but also there is a tremendous buying power on our side as well. - they are up to their necks in other stocks. AMC for example. It seems rkt too. The same kind of losses there. It's huge. In January they lost 70 billions. Since then, they had to short every single day. Not just on gme. AMC too. And other stocks as well (just browse wsb). On Thursday 55 million shares were shorted. On a single day. Remember they also have to raise tons of cash for the dtcc, even if temporarily.   We can't tell for sure how much they are bleeding. It's speculation. But I follow my gut feeling here and if you add everything, it's massive. Exactly. I did that with AMC. Now the house $$ is about to make me rich. You must be retarded. Do you know how many calls closed in the money on Friday? Are you aware of how many shares need to be covered before Wednesday between AMC and GME. It is mindboggling. They are going to have to pull some funky ass shit to prevent either from running up this week. Each round just increases the probability for future spikes in buying volume of shares for call/put spreads. Combine that with a large percentage of held outstanding and shorting. Especially, with retail being a factor in GME and AMC. They can only limit the upticks with hedging. No one has been accurately predicting when one would exactly occur. Just gotta hold and see. This is accurate. If some apes, hypothetically, wanted to cause such a hypothetical squeeze, the smallest price for the highest delta would be most effective.   Corollary: trying to squeeze GME again is a waste of money due to implied volatility driving up the cost of contracts; significantly more leverage could be attained on other popular tickers like AMC or RKT.  If it was combined with a particularly high short interest on a ticker, fun times could happen. Not saying anyone ought to do this. It's all hypothetical autism and not investment advice. So the info I have  gathered up by reading all the  post is, hold my 74 shares that I bought for 5.50$ and go on about my normal day and just let it ride with out buying and selling and go find another stock.. thanks. Maybe Amazon will buy them out and my stock prices will rise. Or does Amazon not have any interest in buying AMC? AMC Direct has good movies Its not nice in nyc. Cloudy and cold lol. I also have no positions in AMC or GME. I don’t care to trade it. I don’t have an AMC position and i hope you win big. I’m not here for that. Lol and how I’m a shill even though i didn’t say anything about buying or selling AMC lol Sure. And you’re a corn ball who calls people shills for educating. I don’t care what your AMC position is. I don’t care if you buy or sell lol. You know people who trade GME and AMC are not normal traders, may not think things logically. If you are neutral then stop saying to people here there is no big day next week for GME and AMC, you don’t know that;) I mean with IV super high and them being covered through 2023 for cash I've just been making fucking cash on the AMC spikes selling calls. Time to push my coat basis negative Jesus man, do you ever sleep?  You’ve been making a negative AMC post EVERY hour for the past two days.  How much are you getting paid?  Just curious. Oh, I just knew you would bring up AMC! There it is! I don’t trade AMC or GME. IV is way too high for my taste. I just cringe reading all these posts tho. Game or AMC. I have no position in either and have no plans to. I hope you all do well. I really do. The market is way more dynamic than what you understand.  There is a very small probability that the options you are trading are from 18 months ago.  Many are from a week or two ago.  Even if someone were to sell a LEAP 18 mths out you don't think some of them bought them back when the price bottomed at $38 a couple weeks ago on GME and reduced the OI.  The volume of the underlying stock is driving incrementally more options sales.  These options are new and the OI is constantly going up and down. Wouldn't surprise me if big money was selling a bunch of naked calls on a big spike and then buying them back on a dip for 20 to 25% profit in minutes or hours.  I sold a bunch of AMC Calls for $17 next Friday when it spiked to over $10.  If I want to I could have already bought them back for 30 to 40% profit and reduce the OI  on my calls.  I am holding because I don't think it will hit and stay above $17 by Friday.  I had some calls I sold last week at $7 that I rolled up to $8 and out a week for a credit. All mine are covered by shares but wouldn't have to be if I had enough capital and options level 4. How is this a negative post? This is explaining how options work. I have no position in AMC. Haha, well that I can appreciate.    Anyway, if we’re wrong about the calls, then we’re wrong.  If we’re right, we’re right.    Doesn’t change what the majority of AMC holders are going to do come Monday.  Which is hold.    So you’re not going to change anyone’s mind.  But if it’s the trolling you like, then by all means. :) When the GME movie comes out... instead of previews, AMC theatres should play this and some of the other TOP QUALITY memes that were created here over the past month. AMC has nothing to do with GME so stfu Why you guys not on #AMC me an friends going to drop 2.mm on it not til I see some action I get GME is the primary objective here, but don’t forget AMC is on the coming too. Watch out for Amazon acquisition skyrocket.   The moon is gonna look like Swiss cheese. Filled with holes from the deep penetration of rockets GME AMC BB is the perfect stack heres why AMC 💎🙌🚀 AMC 🦍🚀💎 Hold The HF’S don’t like it so they have negative posts about AMC The squeeze could definitely happen and AMC to the Moon Hold!!! AMC ""BULL TRAP"" Watch out for hedge funds ""Bull Trap"".  Hello friends,I just wanted to start by saying that I believe AMC & GME to both be under value at current prices and covid restrictions as well as NYC AMC opening back up.     NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01. The street sentiment is that AMC's price will be rising on Monday because the number of shares needed to brought to covered call options expired ITM. Fundamentally speaking that's how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn't make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF's decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.  Let just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF's ""Bull Trap"" so DO NOT FALL FOR IT & DO NOT SELL your shares, they will be able to use your shares to increase their short interest attacks and continues their ladder attack as well. We need to decrease the number of shares available in the float NOT increase it, by selling your shares you actually increasing it. It is very important to decrease the number of shares available in the float, that's how you trigger the ""Short Squeeze"". Why would the HF's buy shares from us at $100 if they can just buy it from the float at $10 or $15 to cover their short interest? Would you?  Example:  On January 27th AMC shares jumped 300% from $4.97 to $19.90 in one day. What was the reason behind this movement? AMC raising $900 million in the week before or the CEO announcing bankruptcy is off the table? the answer is none of it, it was the classic HF's bull trap, the hf was losing so much money in GameStop they needed to make money somewhere else, they intentionally put money into AMC to raise the price so retail investors would jump in at $14-$19 thinking the price would continue to go up. We all know what happened next, AMC tanked 65% the following day and people who brought AMC in at $14-$19 were trapped, hint the ""bull trap"".  I don't know what will happen on Monday, none of us do, hopefully, AMC price will rise to $10-$11, but do NOT FALL for the Bull Trap if the price rises to $15 or $20 if you sell your shares kiss goodbye to the short squeeze. Why do you think the HF vs retail investors were battling it out over 1 cent on Friday? Literally, it was down to the last minute. Those 120k+ call options were the catalyst that we needed to pressure the hf to buyback 10 of million of shares to cover their short interest.  ""(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.""  The approval of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine couldn't happen at a better time for AMC shareholders. The last time vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized back on November 7th AMC shoots up to 90% and closed over 50% for the day. All the weeds, airlines, hotels, and housing-related stocks were also up 20%-30% as well.  A new vaccine approved and millions of shares buyback, it will be very interesting how this played out on Monday.  Do NOT Sell my friends. If AMC goes up then down on Monday... I already transferred funds for Monday to buy in the next dip. I'm at 128 shares AMC right now. I don’t get why people are so anal about mentioning AMC I own and HOLD both what the fuck is the problem? It was over 25 PM on two different days.  If you used a broker other than Robinhood, you would have been able to sell with huge profits each of those days.  It also hit 20 on the 3rd day and hit like 18 on the 4th day in PM. It was on the 5th day that it tanked in pre-market.  And AMC was primed for a jump almost 2 weeks before the 27th. People were accumulating in the 2.20 range and then it jumped nearly 50% to 3. It accumulated some more at 3, and then it jumped another 50% to 4.50 IT then stayed at 4.50-5.00 for a few days until the AH on Tuesday the 26th when it finally broke out over the 5 resistance and that's when a lot of people started chasing.  It ended AH at \~8. It then hit over 25 in PM the next morning before selling off to 13. It then steadily climbed back to \~!9.90 during the day before having a small sell off going into AH and then another recovery. In PM it went over 23.  And on that day it was primed to go over 30 until the RH, Webull, IBKR and others stopped people from buying causing a massive shift in market sentiment. Sir your are welcome to drill my wife.. You sir a legend.  HODL AMC BECAUSE WE LOVE AMC! AMC is a $28 stock by summer without any sort of squeeze...why would I sell at $20??? OP Had AMC   A Mighty  Cock I Got  Death Grips on my AMC fuck their dubious scheming. I'm Rolling With Odin in this war and together were taking home the bounty 20 more $AMC for market open! 🚀💎🤲🏼🦍 + 2 more $GME for good measure Why would anyone sell at $15-20? As the pandemic lessens and AMC opens up more and more GLOBALLY, not just in the US, this stock will easily rebound to $25 and pre-COVID levels by summer I think...assuming no squeeze or buyout. With all of the pent up demand, even if you take the short squeeze or Amazon out of the picture, I don’t think it would be unreasonable to see AMC hit all time highs or $40 range by EOY. My prediction is we will see some type of squeeze or a buyout in the next few months though. Definitely holding until something big happens. I buy more AMC 🚀💎🤝 730 shares of $AMC only 270 more till 1,000. Here comes Monday. Buy more and hold! I’m no pro but I don’t believe there’s a bull trap. The stock plummeted because Robinhood (and I believe a few other brokerages) kicked the legs out from under everyone and halted buying on AMC and GME. Only selling. AMC is a 1000-2000+ stock even potentially 3000+ man I’m holding till atleast 1500. We will set the price. With the right movement and holding from our fellow apes 🦍📈🚀😭this squeeze will be the biggest in history depending on us. We need apes to buy bananas and hold those bananas till they’re so damn ripe they’re made of diamonds 💎 So wait, your thesis is that AMC going up is a bull trap and your advice is to hold? Yikes. I have question. I have 42 shares of GME. I see alot about AMC om here though, but is this just a distracton? Anything other I can understand but the movement is GME AMC two companies we grew up with that we’re trying to make popular again by shooting up the stock price. Am I correct? Do you actively scrub your comments from your Reddit account? Or is this really your 4th comment ever? Curious  OP also sus having not commented for over a year, prior to jumping into GME and AMC threads to hype up. Things are fucked around here By Sumer time AMC WILL BE $850 no bs Yeah, AMC has been a distraction from GME this whole time. They really cranked it up these past 2 weeks though It should make you want to hodl more. We are going to bankrupt Wall Street with GME and AMC. Maybe as soon as next week. 8.01 MFs! Actually, that’s a good look for AMC. It shows confidence in their future. AMC is the most held stock on the planet and way more affordable to the avg guy/gal. AMC has a much better chance as a long term investment. Overall there is less risk. Almost a guarantee to triple your investment w/o a squeeze. With a squeeze, almost everyone invested could become a millionaire in one trading day. GME may look like a better option short term, or for you, since you probably experienced fomo and yolo’d all your eggs into one basket, but this is an AMC sub, so GTFOH with your “GME is the play bullshit” and go back to your corrupted wsb sub and rot there with your desperate friends. I’m new to this WSB too. Like you I bought in T $315 for 15 shares because of the hype. I believe if it wasn’t for the gross manipulation by Robinhood and some other trading platforms this would be way over$500. I have most of my money tied into GME like a true retard. I just bought last week a call on AMC $15. I mean.....how realistic would it be for AMC to do that. I doubt very seriously that Adam Aron would pull that shit. AMC is legit. This happened to me as well. Tried selling my AMC shares, didn't work, sold them again, and I had shorted AMC. I bought my shares back and made 15 bucks. On WednesdayTDA wouldnt let me buy any shares of AMC All the great movie references in the sub make me think about AMC. When the GME movie comes out... instead of previews, AMC theatres should just play this and some of the other great memes that were produced on this subreddit. AMC 🦍🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎 I liquidated all my holdings like $1K and I’m ALL IN ON AMC! $AMC has more potential but everyone hates hearing that. Sleepin on AMC STRONG APES  [How High Can AMC Stock Price Skyrocket Up To? - Franknez.com](https: franknez.com/how-high-can-amc-stock-price-skyrocket-up-to/) Can you make one for AMC!! This applies more to AMC than GME, the Chad should add like 5x his money to the sum he took from the robbers lol AMC TO THE MOON FORGET GME ￼≡  Redditors, Ryan Cohen Needs Your Help to Send GME Stock Back to $500  2/26/2021 1:32pm EST  By Thomas Yeung, CFA, InvestorPlace Markets Analyst  In 2015, the Financial Times joked that RadioShack, an ailing brick-and-mortar electronics chain, should consider selling fruit baskets or turning its stores into Zumba studios to survive. The retailer had ignored the threat of e-commerce for so long that few believed it could survive. Two years later, RadioShack was virtually no more.  ￼￼  Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com  Today, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock sits at a similar juncture. Since the early 2010s, GME’s top brass had treated the retailer like drunks at an open bar — doling out a princely dividend to shareholders (and stock options to themselves) while cutting reinvestment into aging stores. But then something happened: A group of retail investors, driven by Reddit’s hedge-fund-hatin’ r/WallStreetBets decided to take GME stock from $10 to $480 in a matter of weeks. The people still love GameStop! This love for GameStop and disdain for Wall Street is an unusual combo. It means that, unlike RadioShack in 2015, the video game retailer still has a fighting chance. For the good of GameStop and its shareholders, Reddit investors need to finish the revolution they started. And if they do, Redditors and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) founder Ryan Cohen can still send GME stock back to $500.  GME Stock: Intentionally Driven into a Ditch  Anyone who’s recently visited a GameStop store will tell you the same thing: They look old. And that’s by design. For over a decade, GameStop’s management has enriched shareholders at the expense of the firm. GameStop’s capital expenditure, the budget used to maintain its stores, peaked in 2011 at almost $200 million before getting cut in favor of larger dividends and share buybacks. Meanwhile, the company’s stores have continued to age, and layoffs have continued unabated. Yet, shareholders allowed then-CEO J. Paul Raines to maintain the course. Why? It made them money. Customers, employees and other stakeholders weren’t a priority. And after several failed acquisitions, including game developer Kongregate, GameStop’s management decided that milking the company for cash was a better bet. The firm’s blind commitment to mediocrity reached a peak at the April 2020 strategy meeting. There, GameStop management outlined a plan to “optimize the core” and “become the social / cultural hub for gaming” through building “experiential labs.” In other words, they wanted to drive more in-store traffic. During a pandemic year. (How on earth did management earn $35 million between them?)  Change Afoot? Redditors Think So.  All that began to change in August 2020, when Chewy founder Ryan Cohen bought 9 million shares of the retailer. He and two associates would later join the board in January 2021. “GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences — not remain a video game retailer that over-prioritizes its physical presence and stumbles on the online ecosystem,” said Mr. Cohen in a public letter to the board. Investors were delighted, sending shares on an initial run from $4 to $40. Mr. Cohen wasn’t just talking about improving e-commerce (a strategy that might have worked 15 years ago). Instead, he spoke of fundamental changes to GameStop’s business that could create a new, revitalized player in the $180 billion gaming industry. Change, however, won’t come readily. And that’s where Reddit investors come in. To date, Mr. Cohen only owns 13% of the company. That’s not enough to dislodge GameStop’s existing board; as late as last year, the board fought off another activist investor with grand plans for change. To be clear, there’s nothing particularly nefarious about current CEO George Sherman or his team. (Redditors, please don’t send pizzas to his house at 1 a.m.) Managing a declining business is already hard during good times and nearly impossible during crises. But to become an agent of change, Mr. Cohen needs more than his vote in the video game retailer. He needs other investor support.  Reddit Investors, Unite!  To date, Reddit investors have driven up GME stock using a financial quirk known as delta-gamma hedging. It happens when many investors buy deeply out-of-the-money calls — the lottery tickets favored by the r/WallStreetBets crowd. And in one of Wall Street’s least-understood processes, as prices rise, market makers will buy more GME stock to hedge their positions. That creates a feedback loop that pushes prices even higher. But for GameStop to reach a $500 price (and stay there), Redditors will need more than Wall Street’s quirks. To do more, they will need the four tools of activist investors: invest, strategize, agitate and vote.  Activist Investing 101  There’s the obvious first step with activist investing: Investors need to buy GameStop shares and hold on. Options can make you fabulously wealthy, but only common stockholders can vote in shareholder meetings. Next, investors need to strategize what’s best for GameStop. Sucking the lifeblood out of a dying company can make shareholders some money, but it won’t turn GME into a $35 billion firm. Neither will trying to beat established players like Twitch or Valve at their own game. Instead, winning strategies will involve identifying technologies a decade out and investing before others do. (A virtual reality universe, anyone?) Third, shareholders need to make their voices heard — something Redditors seem pretty good at doing already. With a single well-crafted public letter to the board (plus some backroom dealing), Mr. Cohen managed to gain three board seats. Smaller investors might not have the same platform, but they can undoubtedly start pressuring GME’s board to move faster. And finally, shareholders need to vote. Most investors typically outsource voting to their brokerages, making annual meetings a rubber-stamp ordeal. But unless shareholders come to Mr. Cohen’s aid, change won’t come fast enough.  Time Is Running Out for GME Stock  Reddit and Mr. Cohen will have to work fast. Thanks to their years of corporate debt binging, GameStop now sports a 3.5x debt-equity ratio. The retailer spends over $300 million in interest, upkeep and leasing costs, which will burn through its $446 million cash hoard faster than most people expect. Mr. Cohen has presumably seen the writing on the wall. Without drastic changes, GameStop’s chances will melt away faster than the ice cream cone that Mr. Cohen mysteriously posted on Twitter this week. That’s what makes CFO Jim Bell’s resignation on Wednesday so remarkable. Clearing the caretaker ranks is an essential first step to a turnaround, and Mr. Cohen seems to have pulled the board out of its slump. But more still has to happen. And Mr. Cohen needs your help, Reddit. For GameStop to reach $500, the firm would need a $35 billion market capitalization, or more than the value of Twitch and Steam combined. A secondary offering at $150 per share would be a start. A roughly 10% dilution would raise $1 billion, something AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) did during its January stock run-up. But money alone won’t solve GameStop’s decline. The firm desperately needs a new vision among its management ranks. Re-hiring a COO would be a good first step — the firm hasn’t bothered with one since 2019. Charting a long-term strategy (and finding the right person for the job) would be even better. In short, GameStop needs a strategy shift that should make even Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) co-founder Reed Hastings nod in approval. Mr. Cohen has worked his magic on Chewy.com before. And maybe he’s even the right person to take the top job at GameStop. But before he can start down that route, the 35-year-old founder will need all the help he can get. And with a Reddit-fueled megaphone, retail investors finally have the chance to make that happen. Good luck, Redditors. I’ll see you guys on the moon. On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Tom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing. “it’s more risky to not have a share of GME as a hedge against market collapse.”  No. Equities de-risk in a market collapse — GME will not inflate further. GME has a Beta of 1.95, meaning it’s nearly two times as volatile as the overall market. It’s not an inverse correlation, it’s 2X as correlated.    No one knows what will trigger the next collapse. On average a 10% market decline happens 2.5 times per year. Will this be a depression, recession, or simply a correction. No one knows. But returns on capital are 2X the rate of return on economic output. They stimulus is fueling economic output — capital will follow suit. But meme stocks like GME and AMC haven’t yet proven how they will reinvent themselves for high Returns on Capital. No doubt, there’s a thesis for GME — like Ryan Cohen’s idea to turn GME into a digital gaming powerhouse — but this will take time to play out. But it’s more likely that market downturns will happen between now and then, and GME will decline more than market in such a scenario.  If you believe in it’s transformation, there may be buying opportunities. But stocks don’t cuddle. GME as a tendie will fade, just as all tendies do. If you want to protect yourself in a market correction, look to well capitalized companies with strong cash flow. Even better, companies that are delevering, reducing debt, buying back shares. Berkshire Hathaway BRK-B, BMY, GILD all have Betas less than 1. These are the types of stocks to own if you believe zombie stocks (with higher debt interest than earnings) will get crushed soon. Example of zombie stocks are Macy’s and Exxon.  Best of luck. I always thought during the first gme run. That HF short the rest of market. Make 10b and lose 2b on gme.. Die Hard 3. Simon tells McClane riddles( gme AMC bb) he runs around town like a idiot solving riddles while Simon is robbing the federal reserve(short the market) Our movie looks dope can’t wait to see at AMC theaters God bless ALL YOU APES I LOVE YOU $AMC . IM NOT FUCKING SELLING🚀 Is this AMC stonks? AMC Direct has good movies This is just a portfolio shot. Mine looks similar, I see no proof of AMC shares here. You cant just say AMC and not show any positions AMC 🖐🍿🖐💎🖐💵🖐🚀🌚🦍💵💵 🎥 $AMC to the MOOOON! 🚀🚀🚀 I daydream about giving mouth hugs to my AMC stock, does that make me gay? Gama squeeze happening on $AMC on Monday  To the moon 💰🚀💰🚀💰 Unless something drastically changes with AMC business model and/or management I don’t see this as a long term hold. Yes AMC to the core.. I have as many putts on the stock as I could buy. It’s gonna tank like the titanic did. I don’t know why you guys would even think it will ever be a GME.. it’s a 2.50 stock and that’s it’s... it belongs on a pink sheet otc HFs are pushing AMC to get traders distracted from GME. It’s been happening since the first squeeze. Just look at how their trends match exactly. Little do most people know, AMC is not a gamma squeeze like GME. Yes we know. You got into GME and now you hate AMC as is the new retard trend. We get it. Wow you got HUGELY brigaded   It is absolutely on the money as well.  Guys, do the basic level of DD on each business and compare them.  GME is totally different from AMC. Just because ignorant points of view make them LOOK the same, they are seriously **seriously** not the same. Yep new account, have to start somewhere... AMC has been trending downward since 2015. Global pandemic has made it worse. Share dilution on top of that. There are dozens of streaming services out now. Several with contracts with movie makers. I agree there are short term opportunities surrounding the hype, but long term I just don’t see it. Yep 33 days and the truth hurts. I’m all for making a quick dollar but a lot of you guys miss lead young people into losing the life savings to make a dollar for your self. (Wolf of Wall Street) I have lost a dime in the whole GME/AMC/SNDL thing that has happened but I’ve heard about and it’s sad. For starters game stop as a business is crap. All the kids that probably lost there money in the market are the same kids that got ripped by the stores. They ones who have made out are the CEO and other officers that had free stock given to them... not you guys. And all you did was make a group of shit head CEO’s richer..if they wanted to fix the company they would have rolled there gains into making it a better company and not calling it quits. Mind you I have lost a dime... never bought a single share. So I have nothing invested in it. I have putts that AMC drops but that’s the inevitable. Netflix and HBO max are gonna put them out of business anyways. Nobody goes to the theater anymore pre COVID they didn’t either, unless it was Star Wars movies. All of you know I’m right. I’m glad some of you have gain a lot but remember that when you win someone else will lose and some day you will be on the losing end. How many AMC do you hold @20+? Be honest.  Cunt That’s the thing, I’ve been brigaded every time I’ve brought this up. GME and AMC are different and people keep lumping them together. I’ve never said AMC is not a good investment it’s just not a gamma short squeeze. Just trying to help the retards. Bud, theaters are going to be hot with new deals possible by streaming groups like Amazon netflix Hulu and Disney. 2022 is going to be hot for theaters with physical assets. AMC wiped out debts too. Clean slate. This made me buy $25 of AMC. Spread the word over the weekend. Such cringe, much retardation  u/zjz, how is this karma-farming bullshit allowed? The dude is clearly looking for clout and trying to gain internet points. A margin call isn’t a loss and the boomer dumbass and his possible sugar baby are posting this here for what? [because they think they’re just as victimized](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltuu37/3m_lossgot_a_call_yesterday_to_say_that_a_margin/gp24gjx) as the GME and AMC holders when Robinhood restricted trading. Not the same. It’s not news that brokerages can raise the margin rates on a whim, even crayon-eating retards here know that. This IRL retard wrote a $3M check easily after posting this cringe. Fucking clowns, go play the victim somewhere else. That’s what happens when you Short GME and AMC. Write the check. Then jump into  AMC and get all your money back. Problem solved Is Fidelity a market maker on the hook for buying GME and AMC stocks on Monday? Are they maybe calling in margin because they are absolutely fucked and need the liquidity? We should ban AMC posts. The company is just using shareholders money to give themselves raises.  Sounds a lot like the U.S. government. wrong. They made several financial decisions that have not only benefited the company long term, but the stock holders as well. Notice how they have not done another fundraiser and diluted the stock? They also allocated the money very intelligently and reformatted the business for the new age. Anyone holding AMC stock should be thanking them. Notice all the big news outlets are the ones reporting this? Does that not smell hedge like to you? It's a divide and conquer strategy homie. Keep your head up. No. She supports her cause. That's it. She piggy backs to get herself in headlines because she is nothing more than an Instagram thot to leftists and she knows that.   #Here's a recent example:  She joins in Americans anger at Congress for giving a trillion stimulus package that 80% went to Congress' buddies and foreign countries and the other 20% was a measly $600 stfu payment to the people who funded the bill after politicians ruined the country and the economy by shutting the country down.  AOC comes in and acts like *one of us*. Says what we are saying. How bullshit this bill is. How it's over 5k pages and they're only given a few hours to read it before voting. Just how utterly horseshit it all is. Sounds great, right? Yeah AOC! AOC! AOC!!! .....  And then she votes yes for the bill.  She doesn't fight. She doesn't use her *actual power* to help the people or stand up for what is right.  She does what her handlers tell her (which you have to remember is THE ENTIRE PUPROSE OF HER and how she got into office. She was literally a casting call from the DNC to find a minority woman to use as a puppet. Go reread history if you forgot how she was even brought into politics). She has not, nor ever will fight for the people. She will do what her handlers tell her so long as she gets to stay rich and in congress, just like McConnell and Pelosi.   She will make all the tweets in the world to get her exposure, then vote against us every time. Look at her voting record. You cannot argue against this.   This is arguably *worse* than someone who just tells us to fuck off from the start because *at least they're honest* and not betrayers.   Another comparison would be with Maxine. People have been cheering her on *just the same as AOC* simply because they said something about this situation.  And when it comes down to it.. what happens? wants to fuck retail and protect wall street.  Just like they always do.  We would be better off if we had nobody ""rooting for us"" when they're just going to stab us on the back. Dont let a lion into the sheep's herd just because the lion put on a sheep's mask.  If you really believe in AOC then I have a bridge to sell you.   $AMC $BB $GME to the moon 🚀 Go Game S and AMC Not really.  But the smartest thing he could do right now is BUY AMC.  This is not financial advice, it's just something I read a few times somewhere.  He wouldn't regret it. Wsb: ""let's pump AMC""  CEO gets a bonus thanks to share price soaring  Wsb: *surprised pikachu face* Why is it so much hate on AMC??? We are in it because we like the stock GME blew up and most of us saw AMC as an opportunity. Personally I have both but I’m more invested into AMC so to answer your question no this doesn’t piss me off because this is a bullish title. There paying top executives money to stay and turn business around when it was closed for half the year. So now it’s AMC retards vs GME retards?  We may as well introduce politics into this sub. Remember who the enemy is here you hairless shit throwing apes.  I paper handed my AMC and am holding my GME average 19@205.  Short of this scumbag suit we did good things for AMC and should be proud of that.  Too old to be a millennial, too young to be a boomer but being part of this movement was one of the proudest moments I’ve had in a while. STOP FUCKING IT UP.  Remember, we’re all here because we like the stock. Guys, that same CEO staved off an AMC bankruptcy. CEOs will ALWAYS get their tendies. If you think he didn't deserve his tendies, then consider this, AMC would've filed for bankruptcy LAST YEAR and there would be no potential AMC squeeze and no tendies for you and me.  Let's stop with the false shock and awe. In the grand scheme, $3.5mil is a small drop compared to the money this man raised to keep AMC afloat. So, enjoy your squeeze, and give a nod to the leadership.  After all, the hedgies get bonuses for killing companies we love. This guy is a saint compared to them. Focus. Perspective.  &#x200B;  PS. I doubt seriously you'd give a fuck what the CEO got if you made 1000% off the stock. Let's be real with ourselves. I love AMC movie theaters, I am glad AMC will be around for years to come. Covid era will go away… we go back to movie theaters. Home theaters can’t replace a movie experience in a AMC True Dolby Atmos theater. Aww geez now I gotta dump my AMC because of this fat fuck? amc is the stupidest play IMO - i would get out of that shit while you are ahead and secure more GME.   The one thing that’s driving me to GME is that it’s constantly inconsistent - the data that’s being reported from everywhere for GME varies, no one knows where the shares are, and Everyone knows something is sus there.   For AMC, it’s light weight, and that boomer CEO on CNBC has no idea what to do with this company but wait until a vaccine rollout, i wouldn’t get distracted. At least if you get fucked in GME the long term looks innovative and not the same old stuff Just go long $AMC nothing else to think about by low and hold you’ll thank yourself in late June of 2021 when your $Tonk$ are UP ⬆️ His weight weighs on me. Oh I get why it bothers you. It’s the double chin. And he can’t see his penis because of that huge belly. Plus I’m looking at this Adonis and thinking “sell my AMC.” AMC is a private company. Its employees asked to work there and they knew conditions going into it. Why is it wrong for the business owners to do what they are allowed to do? If there companies that made everyone a partner in company's success, then people should apply to those companies for jobs and maybe more will follow suit. Makes me glad I closed my AMC position to buy more GME If y’all really want to respond to this which is obviously nothing new, short the shit out of AMC and stop hanging on to it for dear life with your emotions. Corporate shit will always be corporate shit It’s the workers at AMC that make this a great stonk for any portfolio What you didn't read is that he took a pay cut and also didn't take bonuses. So by doing that, AMC stayed afloat. He could've taken the money and AMC would've been bye bye. I don't agree or disagree with any of your opinions. Just stating what was going on before he received the bonus. Don’t be upset, companies that want to keep executives who they believe in, have to hold up their end of the employment agreements, otherwise this guy (again who AMC believes in) would take his expertise somewhere else that pays him. It’s just business. AMC TO THE MOON 🚀🌕💎🖐 Some of that could be from of ppp loan, which can include historical bonus data from previous payroll reports. Gov. Could be flipping bill on this one with second PPP after small businesses claim first up to March 9. He needs buy AMC stocks with free Gov. forgiveness payroll. Not a big deal... Raises boost employee moral... He steered the ship successfully through the pandemic.. he did a good job... AMC and Hold... aMc holders support gme holders.. apes in this together Let’s be honest, most of us are tryna make a buck, not be activists. We threw money to squeeze shorts, and make money. AMC execs will gladly take it.  Activism starts with inequality, not jealousy. Honestly, I wish wallstreetbets chose Nokia instead of AMC. The CEO is a scumbag for charging young kids overpriced snacks and beverages. He knew what he was doing. Saving AMC doesn’t seem interesting as much Get your AMC calls while they’re cheap. This is bullish and anyone thinking otherwise has a tissue paper scrotum. Me? $.50 strike 2023 calls $800 each. AMC is a shitty company led by a typical boomer CEO.  it's been a fun ride, but he's never been our guy. Fuck AMC... let them burn!!!!!   GME to the Moon Boyz!! You are now part owner of this company and rewarding good management helps retain and incentivise your management.  Read up on the ceo and what he did to save AMC before any of the reddit attention.  As an owner, rewarding this herculean effort on your behalf is good for your business's future. SELL AMC ( now he's  a black sheep of the SQUEEZE family )   BUY GME!!! turn on AMC- GO TO GME💎👐🏽🚀🐸🍦 Yes , this is a good thing. Profitable companies reward their top guys, Why should AMC be any different? Earnings report should be off the chain and this is their way of letting us know. SO LOAD UP!!!! Why doesn't WSB teach them a lesson and dump all their shares. Short them. Hedge funds and WSB team up in the summers biggest blockbuster, Death of AMC. Fuck this. I'm putting puts on AMC. I thought AMC was the distraction play? Are people still in AMC? That douche has the most punchable face. The person who posted this sounds like an ""undercover short"". $AMC will rise. So why do people give a shit about squeezing AMC? I think y’all should just go back to GME and pop that shit like a puss filled pimple!!   Note: Divide and conquer doesn’t always work in the financial industry. Hence the reason why this hasn’t succeeded yet. If y’all stop using ur little tard brains and focus on the main squeeze to squoze then this shit might get squoshed. I'm not sure why this article exists.  People who held AMC this week collectively got more than this.  My AMC calls are all in the money and they got more time for more good news. Put it in AMC dork! Stop trading $AMC take em dn we deserve the bonus not that fat bastard Well, I'm selling amc for a $600 loss and putting what's left into gme, I buy stocks I like. I do not like AMC now. WTF for real?? With all the shit going on and all the apes trying to save AMC’s ass and this guys getting million dollar bonuses??? Damn, duck it...to the moon baby 🚀 Why are all you retards dividing the amc and gme play, they have been side by side since day one. When GME is running AMC is running. The charts have been identical for 2 months now. I didn’t sink a dollar into AMC. My gut feeling was right TIME TO UNLOAD AMC AND REFILL GME LADS! Watch his CNBC interview when the AMC stock price was 4.60 a month ago. He’s our guy: https: www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/25/amc-ceo-adam-aron-on-917m-financing.html  Would you knock Ryan Cohen for getting a bonus?? Don’t forget the objectives here bring down HF. Just love both AMC and GME. This is sounds suspicious great timing when we’re about to Gamma squeeze AMC How many folks lost their jobs at AMC last year? I bet there’s a few AMC employees that might be raging pissed by this. You apes better sell you AMC shares and get some GME while you still can AMC used the spike to pay off their debt and distribute bonuses to management.  They should be thankful to apes and retards. Someone tell him to buy the dip !!!! AMC 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Why would this upset you? Dude saw which way the stock winds were blowing and used the opportunity to pay off AMC's debts to keep them solvent. He earned it. We helped him. Hopefully you made money doing so Well let’s see bonus does not effect any shareholders. We are the buying power. AMC is the most held stock on the planet. It definitely has been shorted into the ground. Almost to the point of bankruptcy for the past 15 months. Hfs we’re betting on it. Then the turn around came. Shares after shares being bought. Look at Friday alone. 8.01 magic number? 🤷‍♂️ we are hoping so. This bus may take a little while to get where GME is at now. But this bus will be there and when it is GME will be holding on to the coattails of the his rocket. Amount of shares are dwindling down to 0 fast. Did you witness the last 3 minutes on Friday to see the seriousness of AMC holders? AMC puts Thank god I didn’t put any money in AMC. GME was the play the whole time and is lined up to be the MOASS🚀🚀 Atleast we know Ryan Cohen and company have us in mind One reason why investing in AMC is like investing in a dead horse. They were literally weeks from folding before all this frenzy. What do they do with this influx? Pay the same cuck who was in charge when they ended up nearly bankrupt after less than a year of decreased traffic m Good job guys . AMC can go back to having near monopoly on local theaters and pay their employees starvation minimum wages with no healthcare. You really showed the ... hedgefunds? Glad I sold all my AMC to fund my GME 💎✋🚀 This is good, means the company is doing good. Means confidence in AMC will be higher, more buys more green Wow it's like AMC is a trash company and should fail so a different better theater company can take over. AMC was always a shit company on the brink of death. They can blame covid, but these fucks were only still floating due to what was basically a monopoly of their niche.  I hate the company, but I like the stonk.   You could say the same about GME and their shitty business practices. The difference is GME has a new massive bankroll investor willing to drag them out of the stone age.   ..and to the moon! If you guys all own stocks in AMC, can’t you guys vote to do something about it? Aren’t you all part owners now? It makes me want to dump my AMC just to distance myself from them. Damn. AMC niggas got hoed He is the CEO and does infinitely more for AMC than any individual person just holding some shares.  This does fuck all to my stocks, hopefully it doesn’t demoralize  too many jealous idiots into selling AMC. I’m still holding AMC and I’m glad to help with his bonus I'm still gonna hold AMC long just because it has great growth potential as theaters reopen, but wow this is deeply upsetting. Wow. Now I care even less about my AMC shares. AMC is a distraction I was sad AMC was part of WSB.  It ruined the movie going experience by creating haves and have nots of normal movies.  It's unfortunate the company was saved Why? AMC ARE CLOSED Sell your AMC and buy GME.   &#x200B;  I am not an advisor, I am a retard with bigger testicles than brains I wish AMC was better than this. I get it but so much of us want AMC to survive. Looks like we need to start the “WSB Drive in” tm. Honestly, I always wondered if AMC themselves saw what GME was going through and just low key pushed the same squeeze narrative. That's why AMC can never do a GME, cuz they don't have the secret Cohen sauce. AMC approves millions in bonuses to executives.....hmmm This happened because they didn’t sell their shares. The owner of AMC believes in what we are doing. The bonus’s he gave to his executives didn’t even make a dent in the billion dollars that they raised....take this down, this is very misleading. $AMC is a distraction. If I was invested in AMC, I would abandon ship and joined the GME rocket. But I won’t tell you what to do. This mf better put every penny back into AMC stock or else I will fuck his wife Well I'm riding the call option exercises Monday pre market and then I'm dumping my AMC at the top. Fuck this guy. He better be spending that bonus on AMC shares So......dump the FUCK out of AMC send a message Looks like I'm about to take a loss on AMC fuck that I put all my GME money into AMC. Did I make a mistake? Well if you're upset then you shouldn't have any stock in AMC.  Stop supporting a restaurant that gives bad service and food like some idiot.   Come over to GME. This is what the DD says about it: (Reuters) - AMC Entertainment Holdings has approved millions in bonuses to its top executives and eligible employees as a means to preserve stockholder value during the COVID-19 pandemic, the theater operator said. Distraction. This isn’t about some ethical ideology from all participants. AMC is simply the vehicle in our instance. Divorce yourself from every board member and C suite. This is bigger than any one position. But what did he do to deserve that bonus? Why not me? I had 105 shares of AMC.... 🚨🚨Retard Thinking Out Loud🚨🚨  I’ve been wondering if it’s foreshadowing potentially good news for AMC’s earnings report. If the earnings report is positive, then maybe the bonuses are “deserved” for saving the company through the pandemic. I’m also curious whether these bonuses are higher or lower than AMC’s prior bonuses.   However, if the company is down overall and still likely failing, then it’s concerning about AMC’s priorities and could hurt the 1,000s of new investors (gamblers) here!  But with that said, is anyone here really buying $AMC or $GME because of the company’s fundamentals. We’re mostly here because some people much smarter than us realized how over shorted both stocks were and the potential for rocket growth if the shorts had to start buying to cover their positions.  The one thing that makes AMC more attractive to me is I feel like the price I currently get AMC for is closer to a realistic price for the stock, so if it doesn’t squeeze, I don’t expect to completely loose my shirt. Whereas with GME, buying at 140 and watching it drop to 40 or less is a lot more painful than buying AMC at 8-9 and watching it go to 4-5. And with AMC, it seems more likely that the stock could recover to 7-9 with the reopening before GME could ever recover from 40-50 to 140-150.   🚨🚨Retard Thoughts🚨🚨 Wtf bro if AMC blows up im selling and buying GME. We the people and for the people I stand 👊 10-4 shorting AMC Holding AMC all the way sucks that every single facebook “wallstreetbets” group on facebook is practically all in on AMC. the hedge funds clearly slithered their way into the hive mind on there. which... comes as no surprise to anyone  we could make more money if we could get through to them. someone without adhd should totally consider it. but not me. that sounds like work Did you short AMC or something? i’M uPsEt a CeO iS gEtTiNg pAiD pLz HaTe tHe StoNk No one should forget that we’re against the HF’s. Business ceos get bonuses. But we have people who bought at 15$ plus that we have to save at the very least. I personally don’t care what the ceo does with the money. The mission dosent change. Bring down the HF’s that are trying to screw us. CEOs bonuses never get announced. This is a tactic to get the stock to drop and have the HF’s win. How many apes are still with me. 🚀🚀🚀 AMC to 100 I don’t understand why this fat man is the ceo they need someone young! Wanna increase revenue? How about start selling better food! I demand Cinnabon AMC! Get to work! If we had never split our focus from GME to all this stupid BB, AMC, NOK shit we would have squeezed GME already tards. Everyone should have just gone in on GME idiots Yes? He fended off bankruptcy and is the reason you can buy AMC stocks while posting rocket emojis and moon memes. I am sorry you found out how business works He should be paying his employees instead of putting money in his pockets! Still, I think we should keep our fight against Hedgefunds. Let’s keep buy and holding AMC shares so that we all get our TENDIES!!! “When movie theaters closed last March, AMC’s top executives including Aron agreed to cut their cash salary by 15% and decrease other compensation over three years in exchange for stock that will only vest if the price doubles or triples, Aron said he would lose $1.6 million as a result of the pay cut. With theaters dark, the company eventually had to furlough about 30,000 people and has been bringing them back on slowly as theaters reopened in parts of the country.”  Directly from the article Word on the street is AMC executives were the 3:59pm 8 million $ buy...💰 When I touched AMC stock I smelled it and bought TSLA instead. I have no problem with how AMC distributes their profits. If you own shares and have a problem with their bonuses maybe you should attend a shareholders meeting... He’s in with the HFs to help drive down price. He was going to get paid anyway. This isn’t for AMC, it’s for the little guy. Us. Let him take whatever he wants. We will take ours and when we move on, he will be in the same place. I feel like this is a lie that’s being pushed by news sources to try to get us to sell. If we think about it, why would AMC not be working with the shareholders to raise the price? AMC should benefit greatly from share prices rocketing or am I wrong? If he doesn’t have a 3-d printed wallstreetbets logo on his desk holding up AMC - this can’t be real or he’s more retarded than us Should we all just spite dump AMC? Yeah sick of reading about amc.  There isn't even a short squeeze it's just like cineworld or cruise ship stonks.  Going up based on reopening and not going bankrupt.  Buy GME for the squeezening.  AMC literally doing nothing other than not going bankrupt.   GameStop is evolving and kicking out people in charge because they can't do anything to help the company move forward. We actually like the stock for what it is.  Amc just seemed like a side show that was there with NOK and other bs to take away hype, and you monkeys all bought it. Fuck you. Tits are jacked.  You all suck. Positions GME 200 shares @ $400+ 💎🍆🚀🦍💪 Yeh, I never understood why everyone was so interested in investing in AMC. The theatre’s have been inserting the non lubed bone of pain up the American public’s ass for years. 22$ for a fucking popcorn? I haven’t gone to a theatre and found give a fuck about watching Hollywood’s latest shit on anything other than Netflix. I’ll wait and if it’s worth watching in a few years, I can watch it in my house where my home theatre is built from the components I scraped and scavenged for.  The best part no fucking apes hooting and holla ring and if there are kids talking or crying in the movie I can put them in their room, where they belong. You guys might not have the stomach for these sorts of things if news like this upsets you guys.  The fact is, this whole GME/AMC movement helped out a lot of people you'd find despicable.  For a few hedgefuds and CEOs and CFOs we fucked over, tons made bonuses and profit and still actually have the control over the ""to the moon movement"".   Not to mention a lot of little guys are going to get hurt to cover the mess for the big bosses.  Did y'all actually believe any of y'all were doing something noble? lol Again, AMC was always a distraction stock and you turds lapped that shit up. I used to work for AMC. It's all for them, not shares. I'm tempted to drop all my amc stocks for gme after seeing that I work for AMC soooo a little knowledge   I’ve been following this for awhile and the whole board at AMC took a pay cut before the pandemic cause things were going bad even before.   Then they eliminated there bonus and structured it based on the stock price. At the time it was around $4 a share and raising it to the $8 to $16 range depended if the board got raises/how much.  We did this! He got this payday because WE increased  The value in this stock. Now I want mine!  I’m still in 🚀🚀🚀🚀  Upvote so everyone see this and know the truth! Everyone saying AMC will go to the moon? Someone else said it’s market cap won’t allow it to reach the same as GME? Can we expect AMC to realistic reach above $50,$100??  Or more Well... AMC shareholders. If you are pissed off about it. Revolt! File a formal protest! Request that the bonus be put back into the company! Or at least give back to the workers on the floor who actually make the profits. Imagine being so much of an idiot that you’d rather take a bonus than riding on the GME wave as AMC has done until now. I mean I’m not mad Monday’s gonna be big for GME. Why the divisiveness? There doesn’t need to be two camps GME vs AMC. Both have compelling reasons to 🚀. Stick together people. 🐒 Shame on you! Apes work together! AMC&GME The company is trying to hang on , and this shit wants payment of over three million,  that just sick , no one is worth that amount of money,  the people working at AMC get paid low wages  so very wrong No, he played you clowns. AMC was smart enough to raise capital during this shitshow and you all paid for it. LMAO. He better get his ass off that chair and get to work raising the price of AMC stock. The timing isn’t great and we’ll leave executive compensation as an overall topic for another day but this was likely already budgeted if certain criteria was met. In the Q3 earnings report, it’s mentioned that bonus compensation budget had been set aside for employees and executives to help with retention and incentive. It’s an easy target to criticize the company but their entire source of revenue was essentially shutdown with capex and real estate costs persisting. They’ve actually done a really good job in the last 9 months to cut costs, run efficiently, and re-negotiate their leases and sell where it’s made sense. Losing key people now would potentially be more costly in transition, onboarding, and recruiting costs.  Don’t get me wrong, the timing is terrible and the company wasn’t doing what it could pre-pandemic, but they have managed through the situation as well as they could have meanwhile having shorts dwindling their value along the way. If you believe in why you invested in AMC, this shouldn’t change anything. This is my first time investing in the stock market. Yes WSB brought me here. I’m not expecting AMC to make me rich or anything. I just invested enough money that I’m not going to miss, and would have pissed away on some bullshit anyway. Like some Marvel trading cards from the 90’s lol. I’m enjoying learning how all of this works and just wants to see what happens in the process. I’ll probably do a mutual fund next. It’s a learning experience and I’m having fun. Why are you angry about that? that is a teeny tiny bonus in CEO-land and AMC looks like it's going to survive COVID now thanks converting their debt to shares. In the face of an unpredictable catastrophy, somehow AMC pulled though.  If you wanna get pissed off check out some bonuses for the CEOs of airlines. AMC Execs are stealing your money. Sell AMC and buy GME instead. Guys this is a non story.  This is the shills way of trying to turn us against AMC.   Don’t fall for this crap. Mass sell AMC!!!!!!! They get bonuses because the company is doing good. So that means we are on the right track and AMC is not a dying company. 🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍🦍 Us retarded autist apes along with my wife's boyfriend single handedly saved AMC from financial ruin.  Fuck the executives.  I hope they give back to it's share holders That's it, I'm pulling my $5.41 out of AMC!  Selling our $AMC now? I wish they used that money to buy their own shares and held with diamond hands a few weeks ago while I was deep into AMC. 😂 Hes the reason it was going down anyway.  He probably was Shorting AMC himself.  Then they elected to pay him as a slap in the face, because the electing officers was In on the Short too. This is there way of trying to rattle you out of emotion and disappointment.  HOLD EM I'm pissed. Royally pissed.  By the way, the majority of AMC's board members are appointed by the Chinese conglomerate Wanda. I am selling AMC ASAP Having worked mid level in larger corps then AMC I can tell you often times bonuses, raises and other corporate indicators are often paid out before news of why they are paid out is released to the general public.  This could actually be good news.  They could be trying to get it in before the end of their fiscal year.      Disclaimer.  I am a moron R- Tard holding 1720 shares bought at $6.43. At a dire moment like this we must remember that it is not he or the company that matters right now. Heck for all I know AMC can just be called Poo, as long as these hedgefunds are shorting it we shall squeeze from them. With that being said they probably meant that he got his bonus in the form of shares BUT, Remember that’s the media. OUR enemy, this is just a random picture of him that’s been manipulated to make us feel as if he’s laughing at our face. This is how the media manipulates. The power is in our hands brothers and sisters and no one else’s. These companies? We like them (assuming you like them) And for that reason WE WILL HOLD. WE WILL SQUEEZE. WE SHALL FEAST ON TENDIES 🚀🚀🚀 This has been the practice in the big corporation world for a few decades. These people are so fucking boring and know only one formula: downsize the workforce as much as possible (cut cost) and raise the remuneration packages , big bonus pay out to themselves. It is so bad that the ECB has to say no to deutsche bank bonus payout to their trading department. But do not let them fool you here,   THIS IS NOT AMC"" -  this is the whole corporation world and has been brought to Europe from America sometimes ago. GME isn't handling their squeeze to help their business out...at all, which in the long run is horrible for shareholders. AMC paid off a chunk of debt, which is better for shareholders short AND long term. What do you mean? AMC played it well by clearing out their debt? It makes the company much more attractive to investors, which is great for share holders who are long on AMC. This is the correct answer. Imagine you’re the CEO of a publicly traded company that’s circling the drain. You’re dealing with the stress of bankruptcy attorneys, layoffs, austerity measures to keep the business afloat. And then after all that, there’s still a good chance you still fail and you’re out of a job and you’re known as “the guy who drove AMC into the ground”.   Then someone comes around and offers you a CEO job at a successful company. Same $, less stress, and no chance of ruining your reputation.  It’s really a no-brainer.  Now imagine if all your senior leadership had the same choice to make. Next thing you know, your company is being run by the guy who used to fill buckets of popcorn a year ago and the whole organization falls apart. I'm sorry, but I was the 421st person to upvote this comment, and you have no idea how hard that was for me. If all of my money wasn't in my AMC shares, I would give you gold. I think both AMC and GME are going to do just fine! Which ever one you’re invested in, or if you’re invested in both, Reap and enjoy the rewards! I’m tired of reading one guy who is in GME say that AMC is not the play and vice versa! When we all make money off both those stocks we should get together and have a GME & AMC victory celebration! Knowing that we put it to those hedge fund pricks!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Actually makes me want to put more money in AMC. Why are they trying so hard? A 29 day old account trying to turn us on AMC?  I think I’ll buy more now. You are correct. as for how qualified he is. he was able to gather 1 billion dollars in the last quarter before wsb even heard about AMC, wipping out the 600 million in debt they had. stood up against universal. and worked months without pay. He also implemented private rentals for movies to keep staff working. i'd say the people talking shit about him are smooth brains.  He seems like a good CEO and deserves a bigger bonus imo but hey company is still not there yet so makes sense to not give a bigger bonus. Because people in GME are for some reason afraid AMC might ruin their “moon ride”. As if the market is dictated by this sub. No way dude GameStop is going to take over the online gaming industry. There are so many different angles that the gaming industry is unexplored and a lot of good DD on here about that. That being said I’m also 💎🍆 on AMC’s future. It’s the other way around. AMC can’t moon without GME. No. His fat ass saved the largest movie theater company in the world from bankruptcy and set up a possible gamma squeeze so us apes can get our tendies. I don't give a fuck what he gets. AMC is back baby! He kept AMC from going bankrupt. Can you do better? I have no stake in AMC, but questioning the media (fuck you CNBC) is the right mentality Yeah, AMC actually did something positive with the huge run-up of their stock price.  They probably saved themselves from bankruptcy.  GME hasn’t done anything to capitalize.  I won’t pretend to know what would happen to the stock price short term or for squeeze potential, but GME really could elevate their footing by taking similar sdvantage as AMC. Nah, I think AMC actually has a business that can come back, at least to some extent post pandemic. So many Amazon buy out rumors flying around too for AMC. Buying more and holding! > AMC is debt free   ??? Wrong. AMC still has hundreds of millions in debt. Bro take the 2 seconds to verify the bullshit you spew. He probably didn’t give them a reason. Two things probably triggered this:  1. His contract may contain a clause that includes “incentive compensation” to tie a bonus payout to company performance, measured in a number of different ways (profit/loss, year over year comps, share price, etc) - this probably would not be a retention scenario.  2. Board potentially decided that with retail traders supporting them, the best thing AMC can do is “not mess it up.” That means steady - don’t rock the boat. CEO leaving is a HUGE red flag for investors and would basically take this “lifeline” that retail investors have given them, and throw it away. This could likely be the case and may be a “proactive” retention scenario.  I would also suspect that a number of other employees are also receiving bonuses, but we heard about the CEO’s because (1) the number is biggest and (2) it makes for a ripe news story for people who want to be angry. A bonus for what? ""Extraordinary Effort""    > Raising just enough cash to avoid chapter 11   Here's a bonus!   > Raised new debt   Bonus!   > Retail investors bought aggressively   BONUSSSSSSSSSS!    The bonus is AMC's way of boning us. This is why AMC is gonna be the first quadrllion dollar business.  It's 2045.  You've just sold one of your child's  kidneys for a small popcorn. Difference is GameStop was not even close to bankruptcy, they had no need to raise capital. Plenty on the balance sheet and closing unprofitable stores. Good shit compared to AMC who was taking massive debt and might be opening sometime this year  EDIT: Completely agree with you that AMC had to do what they had to do, burning cash To be fair, I don't think AMC did anything. They had issued convertible bonds and the bond holder chose to convert those bonds to shares. Still a great thing for AMC that happened because the stock price increases, but not necessarily anything they had any control over. I was 50/50 but realized the plays felt different. GME appears to actually be repositioning their retail strategies where as AMC seems to be making sure their executives are comfortable [It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.](https: deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/)  I don't know if they are totally debt free now, but AMC just ""paid off"" $600 million in debt. Whether the stock goes to $50 per share or 50 cents...It's not AMC's problem anymore; it's Silverlake's.   Silverlake is presumably betting that the stock is going to be worth more in the future. Before, as the debt collector, they can only get their $600 million + interest.    But suppose AMC, now debt free and coming out of a pandemic (with people who want to do anything out of their home), sees a huge surge in ticket sales. Those are now worth multiple billions. And, because they own the shares they can create/sell options for additional income. Wait wait wait. People sold GME and AMC?!? HOLD!!! People really don’t realize how many calls expired in the money on Friday. The amount of shares between GME and AMC that need to be covered by Wednesday is mind boggling!!!! LETS FUCKING GO 🚀 🚀 🚀 So new I'm wet behind the ears...actually fucking clueless.  Have my tiny money on AMC and holding bc I like the stock.  I AM THE GIRLFRIEND. AMC has a shit ton of upside. $600M in debt off the books. Time for more popcorn bowl handies! Yes they are trading very close to each other however AMC has yet to hit $450. Ton of upside. You guys know the Senate still has to pass this right? As long as every Dem votes for it, then it will pass. There are some rumblings from a few members on the left about the bloat of the bill, but if I was a betting man, (I bought GME and AMC at their height, so yes I am) I would still say it gets passed. How many AMC can you buy for $2800?   Fuck.  I was gonna buy shit to help the economy.  Now I’m going to use it in the war.  Then when it’s $1000 I can really buy a bunch of stuff.  Ape thinking’ here. Married with one kid .. so $1400 to $AMC .. $1400 to $GME .. and $1400 to groceries or $800 yolo calls . 🚀 AMC and GME is my stimulus check @deepfuckingvalue and ape gang let’s go bananas If AMC and GME go to the moon, there a bunch of retarded apes that aren't going to need stimulus checks. Buy the dip @ GME and AMC AMC to the moon! Or is that not allowed on here anymore? I live in Georgia. At no time did they say 600+1400. They said $2000 after January 6th. I want my $2,000. I can buy an extra 75 AMC. AMC to the moon autists! I've been biting my nails and sitting naked in a dark room with my phone as the only source of light for days. I are reeetaaarrrd!!!!. This for GME or AMC or...? Probably a dumb questio, but does this still apply to AMC? Probably a dumb question, but does this apply to AMC? Oh they are fucked. Shorting AMC GME and now welcome to the top shorted list SOS. I’m buying 50,000 shares at $5.00 when they open up on Monday. We are going to bankrupt them all. Apes strong. I have hypothesized this same thing. The observable correlation between the rise in GME and AMC stock and the decline of other stocks like TSLA was uncanny.   There is this old adage that, ""the stock market is a reflection of rich people's feelings.""  My supposition as to why HFs are willing to sell off all assets may be as simple as the pay off for successfully shorting out GME would be massive. Perhaps enough for them to breaking even, or stave off financial ruin.   If the stock market is a reflection of rich people's feelings, they are pissed. But furthermore, I see a now that there are also a zhit ton of apes that far outnumber the elite. We like the stock.   Your theory is much more developed than mine, for I am just a chimp that had been given a 🔫. No one should take anything I wroteded here as financial advice. This post is providing me with confirmation bias. Everyone saying AMC will go to the moon? Someone else said it’s market cap won’t allow it to reach the same as GME? Can we expect AMC to realistically reach above $50,$100??  Or more I'm just a working man who makes too much to get the stimulus but I jumped in bought 7 at 137 average. My 21 YO son bought one. We ride to the 🌙.  What I've got in it I just need to repo 10 cars, shit I do that in 2.2 avg. days. Or one lucky day I've done 11 and 12. 💎 ✋ if I lose it who cares. So I have to work to pay rent the rest my life. Already the plan anyway. We also jumped on AMC just in case Possible sure but less likely. Though AMC has upside once more and more states allow them to open their doors. I’d like to see em crest 20-30 a share for sure! That’s still almost triple the current price. Tendies are tendies!! FFS NO ONE CARES ABOUT UR TERRIBLE GME AND AMC PLAYS BRUH YOU FUCKING CLOWNS ARE RUINING WSB PL:DR BUY more! Sell your dog, sell your wife, sell your neighbor's wife and her bf; buy more and hold. This is not financial advice, I'm just a crayon eating tard.  P.S.   WTS Slightly used wife. Taking payments in form of GME/AMC Shares, coupons (Preferably Mcdonald's), and cash So buy more GME and AMC. Got it The last minute of trading AMC yesterday. AMC is such a great stock.  I saw 1/27 it was squeezed and hope for the same soon again. AMC will go to the moon, I will hold until it hits $50, not $100!!! Alladeen snackbarrrrr AMC CEO is laughing his ass to the bank. Congrats on making suits money. AMC shit just seems more suspect by the day imo. It’s like a shit movie, where the clock stops like 1-2 seconds before the bomb goes off, in reference to amc finishing at 8.01, it’s like one big setup to me.  Just trying to distract us from GME IMO. Nah fuck AMC yall getting pumped AMC was never the move. If people never bought AMC, GME would be at $2,000 right now I honestly just don't really see the appeal of AMC Why did AMC even become a thing? It’s only ever truly been about GME. I’ve been invested in AMC and believe in long term growth but to watch that battle Friday really made me believe that this squeeze is for real. I watch the last 30 mins and it really was amazing. I honestly thought we lost and when I clicked on refresh at 4, I just couldn’t believe my eyes, this battle is for real and I think big money is on our side which we will need to force a squeeze Actually this is good that AMC is offering cash bonuses and not shares,,,otherwise executives could have sold their AMC shares to HF to dilute Search YouTube or for an AMC sub. Has to do with the number of call options closing in the money. AMC one isnt like that they jave good mods  I put $200 down today via Cash Appfor shits n giggles. What is AMC projecting to go next week? Lol. I was wondering wtf you were taking about earlier. I don’t believe there are restrictions on AMC. Also, don’t think it would matter. RH owes op the shares since his calls expired itm. AMC we creepin' 📽️🎬🎞️💰💎🚀 AMC boys amc Bb and amc are good stock even without wsb. Ppl do your research on BB n AMC. They are both doing deals and making moves that will make them🚀. With or without wsb. BB n AMC are the go too right now. GME is good to if they finalize a couple of deals they are negotiating! This is not financial advice. Gonna buy some more AMC-D and SNDL-T on Monday... See what I did there...lol AMC TO 200 LET'S GOO AMC needs more loving here. Do apes not realize how diluted AMC is now. They’ve added so many shares - yet everyone still goes on about the high short interest.  They also said 350M more coming.. more delusion..no bueno  Edit: I meant more Dilution.. still applies tho. AMC definitely has the best risk/reward ratio IMO!!!AMC TO THE MOON🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍🦍🦍💎💎💎💎 Lol WSB only cares about GME they ain’t in it for the AMC trend fuck these guys don’t come here for amc go somewhere else boys. AMC has only 16% of short float when GME has 60% !  SELL AMC BUY GME !  [https: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P00011H0G](https: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P00011H0G) I legitimately can't decide whether to buy more RKT to hold long or trade. This comment chain is like after 20 GME, 20 PLTR, and 15 AMC comments, you retards need to start looking past memes to see what legit buys (or other legit buys if you aren't ready to move past memes) are on the market right now. I own a measly 22 shares of AMC, but I'm doing my part and holding. There's been speculation that Monday could be a big day for AMC, so hopefully that'll get more people talking, which'll get more people buying. As someone who holds GME and AMC, I have a lot more faith in AMC making me money. I still like the GME stock but it seems to be an orchestrated dead cat bounce to get retail to FOMO in. Take a look at WSB and it clearly worked. It'll probably happen 2-3 more times in the future because people will bet the farm that GME goes up another 100-800% (and they would probably diamond hand for more because infinity gazillion is not a meme). Meanwhile, RKT is straight up free tendies with no downside risk. My prediction is that when RKT lands on the moon, the 7,000,000 new WSB members will FOMO in at the last minute (see Tilray, APHA, GME, AMC, NOK, BB, PLTR, etc...), and be stuck with the bag again. Then they will hate on whatever the next best play is before FOMOing into the top again. Tendie Man says ""The Moon Belongs to Everyone"" AMC TO THE MOON!! I intend on watching the movie that releases when DFV sells his rights at a local AMC with the basket of tendies AMC recently advertised on twitter Think there will be separation colonies on the moon, those who go there on GME and those who took the AMC shuttle. Like mini gang wars... tell my kids, we don't go to that part of the moon, thats where the AMC people live... hahah :D Team Player Here......Took the AMC play cuz I could get more shares to help the team more than I could do for the GME gang How many tendies can a guy get of 50 shares of AMC? I’ve been holding on tight to my 21 AMC @12.10 dont plan on dumping them anytime soon. Always loved the stonks. AMC and GME to the Moon AMC infinity stone to the collection I’m going to need a bigger glove AMC dilutes shares like crazy and gives their CEO a massive bonus for doing nothing...and you guys would rather invest in it than GME. AMC is simply a sympathy play that won't be nearly as profitable as GME in the long run. AMC is fucked. Maybe you just wanna ride the hype but I suggest you look up what the company did with all the new earning from us share holders. If you’ve never been to the AMC moon, stay the fuck out of the AMC moon ...(Naughty by Nature) The other way around is accessable to more people. I would only be able to buy a small fraction of GME shares as opposed to AMC. Not everyone has thousands of dollars to bet on $50 per stock. The bonuses wernt bonuses IE their buying lambos and jetskis the 8 million bonus went into the stock itsself who u think did that 8 million buy at 3:59? A crazed AMC fan? What do people honestly think AMC and GME will reach? I keep reading the 100k etc, but I'm slightly sceptic. Is there any equivocal theorising for AMC? Not really, from my point of view. As far as I’m aware, AMC short interest is not over 100% (I could be wrong!), so I’m not sure. Anyway, I don’t mean to be a gay bear, but I’ve always seen GME as a better opportunity. When GME, AMC go to the moon. DD on where to invest next. I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.  By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.  Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/  First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!!   Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink.   Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here.   By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.  Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.  When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.  UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!  Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.  Space Ape out  TLDR:   * $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU * $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI * $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot * $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds * $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon  EDIT: Fresh data in.... Added Wendys and the 100k moon prediction I ape, but listen....listen.....  AMC small boom———>GME BIG BOOM.  GME ENDGAME.  Not investor, I APE.  (Ape’s laugh and screech) Dude stfu. It’s not next. It’s now. The only plays are AMC and GME. Consistently for the next 31 months. Until then there will be no other “plays”. Now go make your money fool. 13 more days till it goes public and kids spend money on it like we do GME and AMC... I watch my kids play it while I eat there box of crayons 🖍 buying stonk I like AMC This is sooooo true. I bailed on AMC one day because I was on my phone instead of computer screen. (new to watching on phone.) The candles showed a HUUUUUUUUUGGE drop and I paper handed out. Then I went back to the computer and saw it was just a minor 5 candle drop of about $.12. What had happened? I changed the scale of the chart. Look at at the chart right now for 5 days. Then look at the chart for 5 days without the $140 spike. When it was bouncing between $40 and $55 the swings looked huge. But now that we have it on a scale with that $140 spike it looks flat as a calm lake and totally moving right with NO movement. If Your expecting a spike to $1000 or $1500, that $140 rise with a fall back to $80 is going to look like a pebble on the freeway. HODL Obligatory: This is not financial advice, just my personal opinion and I like the stock. AMC > GME I bought some at 100 dollars but I personally didn't care too much about entries and I certainly couldn't give a shit about an exit.  I just want to see hedge funds hemorrhage cash.  I have some amc also and some spare cash to buy some dips on either one.  Can anyone tell an ape why AMC is such a thing also? I bought one GME share at $40 and was talking to my spouse when it was at around $200 who was like “how many!? JUST ONE?!” But when i mentioned I have 100 of AMC at $7.77 (a significant number for me so i have found it easier to hold) it became “YOU SPENT $700 ON AMC?” “Well more like $800” “Can you pay rent this month?!”   But now guess who wants to buy in? ☺️☺️☺️ AMC TO THE MOON Instead of buying Into GME buy into AMC boys and girls don’t make a $20 profit make a $20000 with amc GME already had its squeeze don’t be dumb by listening to these GME dudes that are losing money it’s too late but not for AMC!!! Specifically this post   https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltxm3c/uranium_tickers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  You’re telling me an account with less than 30 days, posts one time about uranium, gets flooded with random ass awards, proceeds to shit on any opposing comments without providing some kind of DD/evidence, and still has the post up after 7 hours? If you’re familiar with how WSB posts usually go, you know something is unusual about the thread. Comments feel off, interaction isn’t there, responses all feel off.  One response looks like it’s straight up a copy-paste format  https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltxm3c/uranium_tickers/gp372g1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3  WHO THE FUCK TALKS LIKE THAT? “Famous Big Short investor Michael Burry”    All I’m saying is there is some suspicious retards here. Invest in uranium if you think it’s a good investment. If you want to post a DD, actually post DD. Don’t just list tickers, post a one or two line abstract as to why people should throw money at it. Get some $ROPE  Positions: GME 8@100, GME 300C@3/5, AMC 12C@3/19 What price is GME and AMC stocks supposed to be next week? I am behind and in dire need to know where to put a couple hundred dollars quickly AMC is gonna go uppppppp  🚀   🚀   🚀   🚀  GME is for losers no.   apes strong together.   GME and AMC to the moon. [AMC Position](https: imgur.com/gallery/ALElKCs) Don’t hate, apes stronger together Holding 3,000 share and 15 call contracts that expire Jan 2022 AMC is a wrap!! Good luck with that!!!  https: www.thewrap.com/amc-entertainment-ceo-adam-aron-3-75-million-bonus-pandemic /K, buy my shares for $20 each then!   AMC 76 @ 10.84 I’ve got some I bought at 315 so I’m there with you... Is AMC a distraction? I own some AMC as well, however it looks more and more as a decoy Op you have it backwards.  Thanos would be Amazon and AMC would be an infinity stone. In all seriousness though, would AMZN even buy AMC? Didn't this whole rumor start out of pure speculation like 2 years ago? Does this mean I should buy AMC entertainment stock? I only have 2 measly shares of GME @ over $100 and 20 of AMC at an average of $13. I dont want to buy 200 more of each but.... kinda do.   Please just go ape shit on here and share your honest opinion. I understand that your comments are not financial advice nor do I encourage anyone to use anything you see here as financial advice. I will however read each and every last comment even if I only get one or 2 as expected.   Yours Truly  - Depressed Ape  EDIT - this definitely got more love than I thought it would. I definitely won’t risk my ENTIRE life savings and the reason I say “not financial advice” is cause the SEC is watching and we are all adults that work hard for our money! I know not to risk what can’t be lost and appreciate the sentiment.   Much love to anyone reading and commenting and i’d love to reply to all of you but didn’t think this would get more than 2-3 comments before dying AMC 📈📈📈 My advice, just personal not financial because I’m literally retarded, is that it’s not too late for either. Most are in agreement a squeeze is inevitable for GME, they’re just not sure when and how much it’ll rise to.    Maybe give GME some time Monday morning and see if it’s going up or down. If the price is going up buy it. If it seems to be trading down, then wait a bit and buy when it stops or starts going back up. The consensus seems to be a squeeze sooner rather than later.    AMC is not too late either, and it’s so cheap. I bought 50 shares last week, but I’m not nearly excited for that as I am to see what GME does. I think AMC may get to $30 eventually, but who knows when? I BOUGHT AMC 9.9 I'LL SOLD AT 20 O MORE 🇨🇵🇨🇵👩‍🚀👩‍🚀🛸🚀🚀 I am not a financial advisor and have no idea how this will play out. We don’t get to see the whole picture and those greedy HFS are not stupid, just greedy AF.  No idea if it’s too late to join in, but I am thinking this gets sorted out at the close of the first quarter. Currently holding 150 of GME and 500 of AMC. Only risk what you can afford to lose and do whatever is best for you. This sub wants you to succeed. This seems fishy.  You have $500 invested between GME & AMC.  And youre asking if you should throw $20K into them? If im wrong, im sorry.   But i smell something AMC imo is a long way off in seeing the shares rise to any significant value until the theatres re-open.  Probably a few months yet.  I have tied all my money into GS as I see that as the best possibility for the next month with the stimmie and the undervalue of the stock.  Mark Cohen being announced as CEO would help.   We all take risks and this is mine. I got rid of AMC, they are knock offs showing no solid resurrection plan. I put $400 in total between $45-$60 on GME as soon as Cohen was in. When the stock goes up I sell a 1/3 then buy more at the dip. I have 16 shares now, should be able to get another 4 Monday if we get a morning jump and dip. Trying to get a bunch before stimulus. If you can't just throw cash down but you feel it's a better gamble than lotto, feel free to make the system work for you and cash high buy low. Maybe it'll never stabilize and you can just cash out a portion for basic living on all the highs. Everyone has their ideas, but until Gamestop has solid evidence they aren't going to go tits up, this stock probably won't spike to the moon because hf don't have to buy back shares. For what they might owe, they can wait and pay interest, not like they pay a lot in interest, but as soon as it's evident this is a money pit for them and they can't win, the stocks could be worth a lot. Do you believe Gamestop will grow, in our recently germaphobic and home isolating society? Where kids are socializing in person less? Even if it doesn't make 5k mark, it's still one of the most productive stocks I have, and intend to use the hf games to my advantage, and buy as many stocks as I can on its own dollar. In a similar boat as you. I’ll be honest I’m buying more GME for sure. Have about 122 shares of AMC and 17 GME. We are in a historic time so I’m going all in on what I can spend, because if I lose the money, yeah that sucks but I’d be kicking myself if I chose to miss out on this potential historic event. Waiting to see how prices fluctuate Monday and I’m going back in for more I personally like AMC, huge potential I would try to average down your AMC. Try to get between $9-$10. I think you can make More money with AMC than GME at this point.  This is not financial advice. No it’s not too late. Most people are in on AMC from last time. I held my shares 💎👊at 15 bucks a share. Then averaged down to 9.22. If it’s around 8 or 9 premarket hell yeah join us. But hold as long as it takes. If you bail on small profits bail early because we won’t need you, everyone holding is in it from 1000 or bust You could definitely get into GME, especially if you have Webull premarket trading enabled. As for AMC, I think there’s still time to get in before a gamma squeeze. Hope this helps! I would jump in on AMC. GME has left the launch pad too much risk for to little potential gain Sell GME at profit then buy more AMC on the ladder attacks . GME had no reason to blow up like that  again but who knows GME is a freaking anomaly. AMC has solid fundamentals and is in a great position to grow big right now and from a much more broad range of investors  Also a more affordable stock for your budget.  I’m not a finically adviser It’s just my opinion. Do what you want both are risky. I’d say GME is much of a risk . Not a financial advice but I would say focus on 1. If GME squeezes then you can buy AMC after if you still believe in it. Even if they both squeezes at the same time, you'll have more profit in GME. Shorts are deeper in GME and has more long term value at play. But you do you. Sell your AMC👎 and put it all to GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 meant shares  EDIT - 200 AMC shares 50ish GME at most GME is distracting AMC. Those bad guys finished $GME $AMC and started to want to work on $CLOV, let us unite and defeat it Hey WSB Don’t forget about your love of SNDL That 4 bagger plus run helped fund your second round of GME and AMC Come back this week to SNDL for another funding Quick 2-4 bagger just waiting to be started Ahaha that’s how we all feel. But in the end if your bullish on something like a squeeze then even buying as it is, is still very profitable. I’m satisfied with the amount I have in GME but I’m excited as hell to buy more AMC this monday hopefully getting in before the prices boosts cos of the millions of shares market makers are going to have to buy this coming Monday Okay. First off I highly recommend you do independent research and find out about squeezes. Trey trades is a good YouTuber who finely explains it. But to put it into simple terms. A gamma squeeze occurs when there is a strong short interest in a stock (like AMC and GME) then there are hundreds of thousands of option calls on these stock (option call = you by a contract fire 100 shares and it’s just like a betting store you bet that the valuation will be $XXXX. To be profitable you need the valuations I go above that strike price you chose) when this happens. You are making profit and so now the market makers have to go and buy 100 shares for every contract buyers own. Since the price is above the valuation price, the market makers lose money as they now have to buy those shares at a higher price. Whereas they make money by the price going lower than the target price. This is basically what happened last Friday. Majority of the calls in AMC were $8. And we passed that. So now market makers have to buy 100 shares...and there are hundreds of thousands of these contracts. So you can imagine the ridiculous buying force on Monday when they have to buy. This causes a gamma squeeze and as supply of the shares are down (since we are already holding them) the demand increases and so the market price gets higher and higher. The hedgefunds on the other hand. They are buying puts and shorts. And since now the buyers are profitable, the sellers are severely unprofitable and so once all their cash has run out or they decide they’ve had enough. They too will close their positions by buying 100 shares per contract. So now you can see this vigorous cycles of increasing demand and no decrease is supply. And this what basically causes the gamma short squeeze to occur. The buyers force the sellers to close their positions through running their cash dry since they have to pay interest every day to keep their positions open which the interest keeps going higher as the buying power increases and also make the market makers have to buy all of these shares on the buyers behalf. Hope that helped No no no don’t say that. By saying that you can have law suits up your ass from anyone who listened to you meaning that your basically making a risk free play for people as if they lose money they will sue you and get that money back no harm done! Unless you really have diamond balls and are an actual financial advisor then go for it. GME and AMC to the MOON regardless🚀🚀 Monday Mania AMC and GME let’s gooooo.  This the first weekend I’m like who invited these You gotta diversify your bonds n\*\*\*\*!!!!  GME, GME, GME, GME, a little AMC, maybe some BB LEAPS, and more GME! AMC to mars I'm in 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀👍 WRITE THIS DOWN “ A... M... C..” AMC bit*** BB and AMC aren’t doing shit because all anyone cares about is GME. That isn't the intent of WSB. Get some questionable DD, laugh at retards who lost their kids college fund, watch some degenerate drink piss out of a martini glass, that is WSB. ""We"" doesn't exist in the sense you are using it. And from what I've heard from this sub lately, most GME holders don't have an exit strategy anyways, so those tendies are pixels on your screen, nothing more. All that aside, wouldn't you like to position yourself before the hordes of retards pile back into BB? Get in now, if you don't have capital for it then go give handjobs behind your local AMC theater, I think most of them are still closed anyways. >that the Market Maker / big money (usually) that sold you your call pretty much always delta hedges, meaning they buy to cover their call liability incrementally as the price comes ITM. This is what drives a gamma squeeze: as calls come ITM, those with call liability buy shares to hedge, ad  Let me help!     If the options contract is IN THE MONEY then there is ALWAYS A BUYER! If you don't exercise it then you SELL it! To whom!? There is ALWAYS a buyer if is ITM. Usually the last buyers are COMPUTERS. They will buy your contracts for the smallest profit, exercise it and instantly sell it. They do that in microseconds. If the strike was $8 and the stock was $8.01 (like AMC) good enough! They exercise those instantly and re-sell them for $8.011. Remember you can early exercise too, so this happens a lot. Because that's how it always happens. They write many contracts and adjust their risk position as the stock changes.     BUT when it appreciates in ways that no one expected, so as the share price rises and becomes more likely that certain written calls are ITM, then these market makers will rush out to buy the stock so if they end up ITM they can cover. This is really why you can see the gamma squeeze.     In the case of GME it all comes back to the float. Because there are so few actual shares going around when it becomes time for them to go to market to get the shares they might have a lot of trouble locating any- driving the price up big time. This is the theory... Larger floats like AMC won't have a share shortage but you may still see a good old squeeze or a bit of a gamma BUT shorters don't have to cover unless they're margin called- and that doesn't really happen, they can just get more money or sell down long positions. So.... The only real squeeze is a long-term one, when the company actually is doing better and not likely to go bankrupt. TSLA great example. People shorted that for years. Most retails have no patience. Sir this is an AMC/GME dispensary Had racked up almost 10k shares in the $20 range and with the price action not doing jack before the earnings coming out Thursday bought a few dozen calls in the $22-25 region.   Wish I had bought more shares, but if it doesn’t move in the next week much I’ll just pile in some more.  Between making bank on GME, AMC, and MP I’m sitting pretty flush and have been trying to say on here for others to get into RKT... but so many are just like “rates are going up, it’s only a mortgage company, etc”  Laughing my ass off while the FANG and ARK crowd get pummeled I want to point out, RKT CEO has publicly came out and mentioned NOT to short the stock multiple times and issuing the dividend is telling shorts to F off. The company is about long term growth and getting shorts off their backs.   Unlike cough AMC who issues more shares to f shareholders.   RKT stands with its shareholders. $AMC Cup and Handle Formation Yes! An exciting time ahead for AMC! I can't imagine anyone not holding AMC right now. AMC cup my nuts w the slut that jerked me off during Lion King 2.   Leaps for days. AMC is related to GME.   If GME moons  AMC Moons as well The HF won't take AMC away!  To the moon! Everyone’s excited about AMC closing at $8.01 meanwhile nobody’s going to exercise 8 dollar options at a loss. Sounded like, ""I have a buttload of worthless AMC that I can't give away, please buy it so it can get to 30$ and I can break even. "" GME, buy and hodl... Now I see why AMC is a strong buy and hold. Retards, every dollar that you put in AMC is a dollar taken away from GME, or it was, when it needed it the most. Why do you push these crap stocks without a story. Your AMC, I figured out what the ticker stands for: Already Missing Cash. Dumb asses. Seriously, anyone invested, if it ever gets to 15 I'll write you a check. Let's invest in buildings that are empty and sell nothing. Yeah, you're right, that's some DD I don't fucking understand. My brain too smooth... Kinda funny when it’s up 38% on the week. AMC is a sound play, fundamentally and situationally.    Mid term (6-12 months), the company and stock will absolutely boom once Covid restrictions are lifted. AMC could literally not change or improve a DAMN thing about their business and still reach 5yr highs just because of people flooding the place the first opportunity they get.   Short term, there’s a ton of short interest involved, borrow rates just quadrupled this week, and had 140K options expire in the money yesterday.   Does this make it a guaranteed boom this week? NOPE. Are all the ingredients there for a fantastic run up? You bet.   I made 6000% on previous AMC investments leading up to the first big pop. I have 100+ contracts expiring this week that I hope to go red to green... but I also hold shares @$5.20 that are basically a guaranteed 100%+ return.   I haven’t lost ANY money on AMC, and made a shit ton. Yet I’m still bullish AF because I spend my time doing DD rather than shitting on people that have a view point I don’t understand. Why not invest in both, dumbass? Maximize your profits, likelihood is one will be more profitable than the other. I have AMC and GME, i’ve had AMC since the GME boom, i’ve thrown chunks of my paychecks at it. AMC is worth investing in even in the long term when they announced that they will be remaining open and keeping their employees on, that was the signal for me. Even if this doesn’t happen anytime soon, it will when things start to reopen normally again and life goes back to normal. I too have made money with AMC. Send me another message showing me how intelligent you are, after it goes past 14-15$. I will never get another message from you, not for at least two years. So bother someone else. Cancer research??? Is that your take on AMC, we're donating to different cancer research?? I'm all grown up, toolbag, and I don't have a GME position. I've cashed out. I was only commenting, not trolling, because it's clear to see the panic in the post. Please guys, buy AMC, I'm going broke here!!! Tell you what. I'm sure you can get a message to me in some platform. If AMC ever, EVER, gets to fifteen dollars again, EVER, you send me a message somehow and I'll reimburse the 1k or the 5k it whatever your parents lent you and you blew. Fair enough?? Okay then, have a great night! Ummmm.... That's my son's fortnite channel, that was three years ago. Wow, you pussies all mob up together, even when it's clear the dude is begging for people to buy AMC, when everyone that I read that knows ANYTHING says things like: worthless, overbought, worthless, waste of money, throwing good money after bad, etc. I mean if you bought at four and sold at eleven, great. But if I, who is very new to the markets and also new to trading, can invest a few hours into reading to know this stock is going nowhere but down, I just figure anyone can, so if you're shilling it you must be a broke dick. With the fucking cups and handle, give me a break with that crap. The only thing it's breaking thru is four dollars, in a couple weeks or less. So now you poke some more fun at my now 13 year old son, I'll ignore from now on, and chalk it up to one idiot defending another idiot's lame stock post with no merit. Because you maximise profits by doing research and identifying clear risks in each stock.  You literally said logically equivalent to: ""why not just buy **every stock**.""  You know why. Because some go down.  AMC may have some activity over this month, but it has no-way the same situation as GME and most definitely does not have good fundamentals supporting the business. It literally is like that though.  Do some basic research on either company and industry they belong to. Fuck it, look at the actions of each CEO...  Like, if you buy AMC and believe it has a future post-covid you are bewilderingly dense. Bro there's no point in even arguing with these guys. They all bought in to AMC at ten or above, one of their buddies has already posted, AMC to the moon, so that's all they need to just keep buying it. If you disagree enough they send the guy who comments like.... So ooooo..... Anddddd....., or the one that's calls you ""salty"". Fucking tool, salty. AMC is at or very near it's high for the future. **(THIS SHOULD SAY AMC/GME)**                                                                                                                                             ""When the WSB community hoards GameStop shares on margin accounts, Robinhood holds a large amount of shares at its account with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC, the organisation responsible for clearing equity markets).

One stock to rule them all ! Small details like AMC/GMC? Is what causes confusion in the Imformation being posted to all of our 💎🙌🦍's this isn't financial advice, but I'm sure this post was supposed to Say AMC/GME....not maybe they just like TRUCKS. Is cash app a good way to buy AMC? I totally fucked up and my AMC and GME are still on robinhood, what would people recommend doing? I just made a webull account but I’m fucking terrified of my stocks tied up in transferring for 6-10 days. Ugh I have no fucking idea what this post means. But it feels important. I use Robinhood. I tried fidelity and other brokerages but didn't like it. Robinhood  has the  best UI.  I went back to scummy robinhood. And If someone could explain what OP means that would be cool.  BTW I'm not borrowing money from robinhood to buy more GME. Am I safe as long as I don't borrow money?  Edit 2. I sold all my GME to buy more AMC then I tried to sell AMC at a profit to buy more GME. But fucking day trading protection stopped me and now I have 0.7 shares of GME in total. Fucking hate my life After 2 months they finally responded to my account verification customer support ticket. It was about my address because it's a fraction and their system does not allow a fraction. My response to them was.      I already got my AMC shares from TD Ameritrade weeks ago. Vlad wants to be a jerk so I do not need the Robinhood exchange. I can do OTC and options. So I guess it really doesn't matter I won't be using RobinHood anyways.       This company has proved to be exactly what the American people do not need. From what I remember I don’t think so. I know was still able to buy AMC & NOK when RH placed restrictions on them. The app wasn’t working, but I was able to go on the website & do it. AMC Apollo 1000 310 here . But I think I’m gonna hop on this AMC train with my apes 🦍 and come back with more bananas. This is the way I took a time out from eating crayons and watching my wife’s boyfriend work his magic because my smooth brain thinks that AMC and GME just happen to be in some many of the same funds. Right? And all of those commercial real estate funds got hammered by Covid and then targeted by those bloodsucking short sellers. No surprise to me they have similar patterns but I suspect the biggest shot we have is with GME. I think that 🚀 has more fuel than AMC I loved how just last week (before the spike of course), we had some members of the WSB community making fun of $GME ""bagholders"" and telling us to ""let it go already"".  Well....IF YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE FOLKS FUCK YOU BECAUSE $GME & $AMC HODLERS ARE ON A ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON AND YOU'RE NOT INVITED SO GO SHILL SOMEWHERE ELSE. I got lucky with AMC, I bought 800 shares at $2.19 in hopes it might go to $4+... didn’t have a clue about WSB’s, short squeeze etc. Basically putting my profits from AMC into GME. We can speculate all day long about short interest, naked shorts, etc. nobody really knows for sure. I just know the guy that saw this coming last year is still in, and doubled down. To each their own, but that’s enough of a reason for me to see this thing through...  Not financial advice... I’ve found plenty of DD on why GME is prime for take off, but no one can provide me with actual information on AMC, everywhere I look, as far as I can tell, anyone in AMC is just getting played.  I would love to be proved wrong, but options volume isn’t there. Short volume isn’t there, they aren’t changing their business model.   Give me an actual reason to like AMC. This dumb ape's take: AMC is getting a crazy halo effect from being (rightly or wrongly) ""the other GME."" See how many people have been pointing out that their charts have been very similar. If you're bullish on GME, and think the squeeze is yet to be squoze, then I think it's reasonable to plan to dump your AMC at the same time you finally sell your GME, since they should both be as high as they're going to get.   I am dumb. Please do not take my insane ravings as anything more than the babbling of a lunatic. Do not make financial decisions based on anything I say. AMC seems like it'll get a small boost when movies come back later this year.  That's about it.  Probably get to around 20 or so a share again.  Definitely not going to the moon.  It's a medium term play. AMC is for those apes who don’t understand market cap AMC is not shorted so no movement there.  When the theatres re-open then there will be significant movement.  Buy low and wait it is coming.  I am all in on GME though if that goes that's where the $ are but losses will be the same.  Not that it matters cause I'm not selling!!!! I'm not sure on the AMC rocket any more. If game stop popped off that first week like it should of AMC (and Nokia and berry) would have spiked after the game selloff because that's what was being pushed to the millions of new members here. I'm not sure that's going to Happen now with the hype dropped off. AMC might still spike on the selloff. When game hits liftoff it's going to be a busy day figuring out what to grab with the gains on the rise to dump probably by the end of the day. AMC was also in a position to face a short squeeze, but it looks like the hedgies *actually did* close their positions on it. IDK if your question was serious or not, but I'm going to answer anyway - and sound really stupid doing so because I'm just someone who doesn't play video games, never has, & I think the closest I've ever come to walking into one of these stores was dropping my son off at midnight to stand in line to get the newest Halo game. (As a book editor I'm ashamed of that run-on sentence).  So, according to the article, buying options is the **wrong** thing. I see a lot of people buying options when according to the article, they should be buying **shares** & holding so they can vote. The article says once you're a shareholder, write to the board, but it doesn't say about what (strategy ideas maybe?).   The article also mentions that the customers of Gamestop are mostly the older crowd. So I'd assume that they would want to appeal to the younger crowd now. Or how would they change their model to make more of the older crowd walk into their store, or ship from their locations to the homes? Hell, he made Chewy an online retailer, so why can't he do that with Gamestop? Why can't they be the #1 online retailer of games & partner with Microsoft?  It mentions getting the share price to $150 as a first step, and it's been working it's way up there. Yes, it mentions $500 but the dude can't expect miracles right off the rip, especially during Corona.  You guys have had ideas of merging GME & AMC before & I've heard of places forming what they've called ""teen nightclubs."" A city close to me just did something like this with an arcade, pool hall & movie theater, coffee shop, and McDonald's all attached. It's right in what they deem to be the ""town square"" (they're trying to bring back the old time feel). There's a beach down the road & a permit to carry alcoholic drinks from several bars was approved by the city last summer. Yeah, I know - a teen club + adults walking around with booze & a big body of water at the end of the road - recipe for disaster, right? But.. it is what it is! Sounds like a good time though!   Drop the kids off at the kiddie club, mom and dad head to the bar. They all meet up later in the town square.  So, the idea of AMC & GME may work for something like that. Hotels have been known to have theaters, arcades & bowling alleys, too.  So, there's my dumb idea. Who told you that? I just had a dream AMC went to $30 and I specifically remember seeing the $30.00 on my phone. If I buy with money from my bank account then I’m good right ???    433.233 AMC avg 10.37 each  19.68 GME AT AVG 133.14 each so far ....  paid for with cash .....  from my checking account . Should I still move from RH They restricted SNDL as well Don’t forget where your extra funds came from WSB Boost SNDL next week to gain more for the GME and AMC run WSB didn't save AMC. It's been explained a hundred times already. They did save AMCs creditors a lot of money though. Whole foods was a successful business that was in an area Amazon was looking to move into.  AMC is a failing movie theatre.  Amazon may but up the remnants during the bankruptcy but that's it. $CTRM Castor Maritime 👨🏻‍🚀 do not forget about this one too. We are GME AMC CTRM crew!

(Besides the other ones that get lumped in with GME like AMC, etc) Not saying it will happen but it almost sounds like if the market actually crashes, it would send GME and AMC to Valhalla but not for the reasons OP listed. I mean the correlation listed is still there but it’s due to de-risking. Interesting. But it would also mean, if the market continues to slide, and shorts have already covered causing a squeeze, AMC and GME sell off would happen pretty quick after the initial squeeze reaction and longs and shorts rebalance on it them. AMC stock mutual fund ownership is a bit above 3000%.  Eventually this will come in full effect, whatever how long they can postpone it, this is gonna hurt like a mofo.  Greasy wedgie for the hedgies I should have bought the GME dip but I've got a lot dogged into AMC best luck with your conquest GME brethren! It’s so weird that on this very wednesday (24/2)I saw GME at 46 lol. I cannot grap why some retail traders would even dare buying those shares at 100 or more. I feel like this trend is attracting some traders in a way that in the long run will not be good for them. I feel some newbies are not even interested in learning, taking 15 minutes of their time to check graphs that any new trader could understand. Hell, I placed 10k on AMC at 8, and I’ve seen people buying at 14, 15, thinking it will reach 500. My gold to go rule is selling as soon as I double. Delete less then 10k? Unless the rules of deletion is AMC only Shorts, lots of them, apart borrowing shares for shorts I don’t think it’s possible to go above 100%.   GME mutual fund ownership is 3192 %, AMC at 3000% ish, PLTR at 182%, BA at 1700% since everyone expect it to sink after the lost motor.  What is going on right now is absolutely crazy. I’m thinking about getting in RKT and a few others. Wow, I had AMC 1DTE too which expired worthless yesterday, but I only put in $700. Are you seriously telling me you put 100k into GME options AFTER the pop w 1400% IV?   Wow... Is AMC a distraction? I own some AMC as well, however it looks more and more as a decoy What’s interesting is that in the past the short squeezes were mostly orchestrated by one individual/entity.  With GME and AMC, it’s an unknown mix of retail, whales, and rival hedgefunds. While we may appear to have a single hive mind here, what’s going to work against us are differing sell points and determination to hold. Stonks\* only go up. Only GME and AMC This post will probably get buried, but whatever, it's funny.  I went into get tested for Covid this afternoon after being exposed, nothing special. But I'm also buying dips on AMC at the same time and as a result, almost missed my name being called multiple times by the receptionist when my turn was ready. Tunnel vision is real.  I get the swab and chat with the doc for a minute or two about all the Covid craziness and just overall life shit. He's a cool guy, super laid back and what not, and after a bit he steps out to go find my results. I'm chillin in the exam room, waiting for my results and of course, I'm still on my apps, just habitually watching the price and debating if I should go in on some more or not. About five or six minutes go by when my doctor returns with results. I didn't realize he could see the basic idea of what I was doing on my phone (price-watching etc) and as he passes me, I hear him say, ""Niiiiiice.""  Being in the exam room and awaiting my results, I chime in with, ""Oh sweet, I'm negative?"" He responds with, ""Nah, I saw the stonks on your phone. Good luck, retard."" There's a pause in the air before he mentions Reddit and WSB, just to laugh off a potential HR issue calling a patient a retard, Turns out he's here somewhere in the 9 million strong pulling for us and has been holding strong and buying the dips too.  Anyways, TL;DR: My doctor said ""good luck, retard"" while catching me buying dips on AMC and he's here somewhere in the WSB crowd.  Diamond hands, Covid neg, TO THE MOON WE GO! Some of you may know that AMCX spiked on Friday. There's many that believe it was from lost Apes buying the wrong ticker. But it could have been because of the upbeat earnings call they had prior to market open.  Is anyone thinking of putting in a short or options play against this sudden spike?  Seems like an appropriate play to talk about in the bets forum because of the risk involved. If its played short because a bunch of people bought the wrong ticker then great, puts and shorts will print.  BUT... If it spiked in legit fashion from the earnings call rather than way ward Apes buying the wrong stock.... well, that's a lot of premium and buyback to gobble up the bank account.  I know everyone just upvotes memes and 🦍🧠💎✋🚀🚀🚀🍌 but every once in a while its fun to get quasi cerebral.      Show me your thoughts and/or THOTS ? It's not wayward apes. The report was good, and on paper AMCX had a higher short ratio and higher short interest than AMC.  I think I said this before, but it was ripe to squeeze a bit.  Short interest has ""come down"" to 29.02, which is still high, but it's also come down for all of the most shorted stocks in the past few weeks.  [https: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15b\_amlFiX1bwpsl1ysrk3SAzNsFMIllLgfilBS0f7jQ/edit#gid=1415361390](https: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15b_amlFiX1bwpsl1ysrk3SAzNsFMIllLgfilBS0f7jQ/edit#gid=1415361390) They had great earnings and it’s a highly shorted stock with low float (though a significant amount of shorts have covered in the past month). TBH I’ve always wondered if the original mistake was people buying AMC instead of AMCX not the other way around.  Anyway I expect the price will drift lower but I’d buy puts, not short, just in case. It’s still 4 days to cover. Ticker? Some AMC/BB shit? No one thinks that the $1.9 trillion stim being passed in the house and the Johnson and Johnson FDA approval for emergency rollout of their vaccine are strong bullish signals for recovery stocks? IDK about bond rates and I think after next week many will see the potential in Oil, many already have. That’s what I’m in. Of course I am holding GME and some AMC because they are obviously sound financial investments. I think if we don’t bounce next week we will soon. I am dip buying all the way down. Hoping that the one shot vaccine approval will be an extra push for AMC to breakout. I think the stimulus is already priced in for the most part... might pop up and recover from last week though. Or we could continue the bloodbath in tech lol Is AMC a distraction? I own some AMC as well, however it looks more and more as a decoy BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon.  HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK. Holding my measly 2.69 shares but holding none the less.   If AMC takes off then I’ll gladly buy 20-30 more GME. I recruited an astronaut to help get us to the moon. He’s also an actor, scientist, doctor, and lawyer, and seriously knows his stuff! He loves the movies and we love the stock! Long live AMC! Love this shit. I'm a newbie, Bought 600usd on GME and AMC on Thursday, it's not much but it's all I can do right now. to the moon apes!

Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.  This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).  It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.  There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.  AMC has A LOT MORE: [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.  BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.  NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.  Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).

Manage risk and tendies will follow  https: www.highshortinterest.com /There's a stock called RKT. Year 30, they’re still buying fds on RKT ‘for the memes’ This is accurate. If some apes, hypothetically, wanted to cause such a hypothetical squeeze, the smallest price for the highest delta would be most effective.   Corollary: trying to squeeze GME again is a waste of money due to implied volatility driving up the cost of contracts; significantly more leverage could be attained on other popular tickers like AMC or RKT.  If it was combined with a particularly high short interest on a ticker, fun times could happen. Not saying anyone ought to do this. It's all hypothetical autism and not investment advice. Everyone should understand that markets are pulling back because of margin calls not fricken interest rates. I’m buying call options on $RTX $RKT $BB $BA $TSLA $AMZN $BABA $JD $PYPL. Trillions are sitting on sidelines and are about to be put to work. I believe we are about to witness a huge bull run. Don’t even get me started on Home prices hitting higher highs.

When I get vaccinated I’ll be back playing baccarat as well. 🍻 Dumping it RIGHT into the $RKT squeeze! Worst case I collect the free 5% dividend payout, best case TENDIES ON THE MOON  Not a bot, not financial advice RKT actually makes $$$$ Can people shut up about RKT? It's the same as NOK. A scam by bots. So what would drive that? Like I don't know if your investments are based on meme cycles that's pretty rough.  RKT bumped from killer earnings I legitimately can't decide whether to buy more RKT to hold long or trade. This comment chain is like after 20 GME, 20 PLTR, and 15 AMC comments, you retards need to start looking past memes to see what legit buys (or other legit buys if you aren't ready to move past memes) are on the market right now. RKT has the most asymmetric risk/reward. Floor is $20, and we can hit $50 due to the massive short interest, the special dividend, and the company buyback that are all intended to cause shorts to run for cover. 100% of all of these are shills. PS  RKT to $50 by 3/19 RKT IPOed last year, they're actually profitable and making a shit load of money. They killed earnings and gave a special dividen out (all this during a dam pandemin). Where you not around when RKT was like the top meme stock on this sub for like a good 2 weeks? RKT is a good companie, I sold my FDs last Fri for a good profit.  Possitions 900shares of GME on margin and selling weekly FDs to all you retards I still like the GME stock but it seems to be an orchestrated dead cat bounce to get retail to FOMO in. Take a look at WSB and it clearly worked. It'll probably happen 2-3 more times in the future because people will bet the farm that GME goes up another 100-800% (and they would probably diamond hand for more because infinity gazillion is not a meme). Meanwhile, RKT is straight up free tendies with no downside risk. My prediction is that when RKT lands on the moon, the 7,000,000 new WSB members will FOMO in at the last minute (see Tilray, APHA, GME, AMC, NOK, BB, PLTR, etc...), and be stuck with the bag again. Then they will hate on whatever the next best play is before FOMOing into the top again. ALL ABOARD THE RKT SHIP. 1 WAY TICKET YOU DIRTY FUCKING APES Shorts have been suppressing the price for months, genius move on the part of RKT management to smash them with the $1.10 divi.   New money will come in leading up to March 9th, finally breaking us out of this resistance at $24.  Shorts will also have to pay divi out of pocket (fuck em) AND a squeeze should be triggered as they scramble to cover. HOW HIGH WILL IT GO!? I think this is a fantastic company but sometimes a fantasic company doesn't translate into a fantastic stock price for whatever the reason. In this specific case, I have no idea WTF is going on. RKT's market cap should be close to double what it is now considering all the growth it has experienced. I mean, minimally it should be a $30 stock, and that's the floor. And yet, it trades consistently between $18-24. It doesn't make any damn sense to me. RKT to 💯🎯🚀 I got out of RKT not so long ago.. too much rollercoaster ride for me.. it should of been like $50 already Dear Autists,  This is your wife’s boyfriend speaking. RKT has an unreasonably low PE, has billions in cash, announced an insane dividend, killed earnings, has massive growth potential, is the 3rd most shorted stock on the market and the stock is owned 95% by RKT insiders meaning they will inevitably control the price in the short term future. The CEO will use the dividend and buy back program to annihilate the shorts and drive the price wayyy up, potentially to the 50s short term. This is NOT casino here, it is a legitimately undervalued company to invest in with little to no downside. This is a rare opportunity, please go balls deep in RKT on Monday apes.   Love y’all😍 Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰  Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:  When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.  RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself).   $RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back.   It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT.   BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?  GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you.   The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.  Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November.   Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.  BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:  Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?    TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌   Edit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40. To those who have family members who are special needs, I apologize - I am merely speaking the language of my targeted audience (WSB)  Positions: https: imgur.com/a/DbOCCYG (PTON is another story for another time) **NOTE:** I also have another 60k of RKT in my Roth.   ALSO THIS POST IS NOT A DD. To read my DDs on RKT click below (three DDs in one):  https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf I’m surprised more apes aren’t in on RKT simply because of its name. You fucking retards thinking GME is the only play in the stock market is becoming increasingly more frustrating.   I was hesitant on RKT, I even commented earlier this month describing my concerns regarding the potential negatives in the housing market. Sometimes it’s important to see things from both sides of the coin, and my bearish mentality was squashed after RKT’s recent earnings report.   There is no doubt to where RKT is heading. Here’s what I would suggest:  - roll your options from short term to leaps, even if that reduces your lotto positions. - keep adding shares under $25, it’s a no brainer. - stop worrying about informing retail on it’s benefits. They play such a small roll in it.   GME has stolen the show (I’ve got various positions in it), and there seriously is a weird mentality on WSB. It really won’t last forever and will cycle, just like mid-February.   Use this time to increase your RKT positions, especially while institutional investors increase their holdings (this is guaranteed).   RKT is a home run, potentially a grand slam. 10 baggers like this one don’t need viral assistance, in fact, it probably does it a disservice.   TLDR; I don’t just like this stock, I love this stock. Rocket $RKT gonna 🚀🚀🚀 it’s all in the name lads! DD makes perfect sense. I got spanked pretty hard buying GME out of the emotion of sticking it to the hedgies. This time I actually see long term sustainable value in RKT's coming squeeze. The squeeze id just icing on the rocket shaped cake for me. I bought my first ever calls before market close, I for sure think its set to pop in a big way.  What my fellow apes fail to recognize is for all the fun we're having losing money in GME, the company itself isn't doing a god damned thing to help the squeeze. RKT is actively setting the stage, offering a dividend incentive to do it, and planning to buy back float to increase the scarcity for shorts to buy back once they want out.   If you want to stick it to hedgies and don't give two shits about the long term of RKT, then at least collect $1.11 per share of literally free fucking money while shares are cheap then sell once you collect late March. I’ve been fucked by RKT before, fucked me good enough to go back for seconds I suppose, I’m in. Sitting on 500 shares of RKT now and 23k cash might yolo 1000 more shares. Dan G's shares are class D. the divvy is for class A only.   So shorts pay and RKT only spends 100 million  80% borrow fee 🚀🚀🚀  Small float  Billion $$$$ buy back  RKT 🚀🚀🚀 OP left out a buncha things. I think he ran out of crayons:   * The $1.11 special dividend is screwing  the shorts. If they own the stock til the dividend date, they have to pay the dividend to the folks they borrowed from. * RKT doesn't need the fucking money. They're profitable as fuck. They only did an IPO to allow insiders to have liquidity and/or acquire other companies. * Nearly all the time when a company is shorted, they expect it to lose money, or it's overpriced. Like I said, they don't need the money. However RKT did just have a huge 3rd quarter (and 2020) due to refinancings, so next year won't be as profitable. But they're still growing fast. * The lockup period for insiders to sell their stock came and went. No one sold, they know the stock is worth more.  * Main risk for a mortgage company is rising interest rates. The fed has said they'll [maintain the low rates until 2022](https: www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/fed-meeting-decision-interest-rates.html) * Because of the buyback program, the stock can't go down much. If it does, they'll BUY IT BACK. Stupid shorts, how are you going to make money if it the company will prevent it from going lower?  I personally think the special dividend was a FU to the shorts, and they'll start their buyback leading up to the dividend as a FU twice. So unlike GME we aren't relying on paper hands to squeeze the squoze. There's a billion dollars of squeezy-squeezy coming. We just don't know if it'll squeeze quick or slow.  Even if nothing happens, the likelihood of the stock going down is as small as your pecker in freezing ice cold water in the middle of winter. If you're going to try f'ing the big shorts, don't you want to practice safe sex?  I also like the stock. Will be holding long term anyway. They have really aggressive expansion plans which will pay off for years. 5k shares checking in  also they ***GUIDED Q1 UP 90%-99%!!!!***  RKT 🚀🚀🚀 \[̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅\] 🚀🚀🚀 Where the hell are you getting the ""RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares"" figure from? Had racked up almost 10k shares in the $20 range and with the price action not doing jack before the earnings coming out Thursday bought a few dozen calls in the $22-25 region.   Wish I had bought more shares, but if it doesn’t move in the next week much I’ll just pile in some more.  Between making bank on GME, AMC, and MP I’m sitting pretty flush and have been trying to say on here for others to get into RKT... but so many are just like “rates are going up, it’s only a mortgage company, etc”  Laughing my ass off while the FANG and ARK crowd get pummeled Where can you find the ownership % for RKT? It doesn't look like it's publicly available RKT mannnnnn I want to point out, RKT CEO has publicly came out and mentioned NOT to short the stock multiple times and issuing the dividend is telling shorts to F off. The company is about long term growth and getting shorts off their backs.   Unlike cough AMC who issues more shares to f shareholders.   RKT stands with its shareholders. Someone slap my monkey brain if I didn't get this right...but this is what I'm anticipating.  1. Special dividend. That's the first kick in the face for the shorts.  2. Special dividend at a crazy high price of $1.11 per share where the majority of shares are held by RKT insiders + retail investors like me + (here's the ""if"" part) if all of us being bullish on that and REINVESTING dividends = buying up more of the float. That's the first kick in the face  3. IF the CEO is really just loading up a big middle finger on the shorts, which it kind of looks like it, then he initiates the $1B buybacks at the same time the dividend pays out (March 23rd). A third kick in the face for the shorts.  Isn't that potentially the most brutal attack on shorts ever? So what is the play? I'm pondering an April 1st, 2021 call (after the dividend) for $21 and adding to my leaps that go out a year or two (not sure on the amount).  Are there any gaps in my understanding, idea, etc? Do those calls make sense for time and price?  Maybe I should just keep buying the stock instead. The short term options seem pretty attractive...lol RKT to 💯🎯🚀 I'm not seeing the connection here. Dividends go to shareholders. Even if they are insiders (i.e. employees of the company), that does not mean the money is going to the balance sheet of the company. The company can't use funds from its employees' bank accounts to fund a buyback.   I think RKT is interesting, but I'm not sure about this logic. > WHAAA STOP BUY GME U TARDS.... look here, look at RKT, it's literally a rocket to the moon hahahaha go buy that instead Were you here when it IPOd? Replace GME of today with RKT of then and that's what this board looked like. WSB was RKT crazy when it IPOd. I have been in since shortly after IPO so nice to see it get some attention again. ..and that is RKT emoji to the moon or conversely...  get RKT? Days to Cover is just over 4+ now. The 02/25/21 update on SI through 02/12/21 push the number up to 43 mil shares.   The spike end of Jan was only about 6 mil shares cover and that pushed it from around $20-$23 before the shorts loaded back up. If you consider ~$.50/mil short, the squeeze would be $20+ and push this in to the $40's long term as the shorts unwind(and close to my price target of the upper $40's from my earlier DD on where it should be valued). Financials trade around 12x annual ER. The would be ~$48 if RKT was fairly valued. Unwind the shorts, and your there.  With strong retail next week, this could easily hit $50+ if shorts are forced to cover(interest payments go up the higher the stonk's price, the dividend adds more pressure to cover). You're fucking retarded, if someone follows what you said at the end of your comment they will literally make $0.  As soon as the $1.11 dividend is paid out, the stock price will drop by that much.   I'm big on RKT and planning for a long hold so don't get me wrong, I like the stock, but to buy shares to get the dividend and immediately sell in March is dumb as fuck. Stocks can be value and/or growth.  RKT is the ""and"". There is no catalyst per se.  They are growing organically eating market share and expanding into ancillary businesses.  The 95% closely held shares is a risk.  In fact, I believe that's why it's shorted.  But, RKT looks to be as interested in fucking the shorts as reddit so I don't see how the shorts win this 5% equals 115,000,000 shares in RKT CLASS A (public float) Common stock, 95% Dan Gilbert(owner) class D (not common or float) Also, isn’t this SD a tactic to pressure the shorts? Plus buybacks? RKT mgmt is doing the actual work from the inside. If more retail figures “this out, then 🚀, no? Dan Gilbert has spoken to this topic in his speeches. This sentiment is due to the fact that $RKT actually checks that people can pay their mortgages. It didn't fail in 2008 for a reason. It has stricter lending requirements ie: not retarded. This is also why people say they have higher rates, well, they don't. They just have higher rates for riskier people that deserve it. >financials trade around 12x annual ER.  what does annual ER mean? sorry im retarted - but RKT go up Abundantly clear that’s what the market has been doing to RKT since august 2020. Could they stop an intentional short squeeze though? Yeah thats fair criticism, I can't say I disagree with you, but I'm also 80% long position and 20% call on RKT. Unless it goes up by more than $1.11. Which, granted, is a tall order for $RKT unless dynamics do actually change. All mine are set to expire 03/19 which bear in mind is after RKT counts who gets the dividends, but before the checks are sent.  I chose one in the money at strike $21.5, two out of the money at $24 and $30. I only did the high of $30 because I was short on funds and it only cost $38 lol. Perfectly understandable I wouldn't want to trade a buck for negative 5 bucks. However, looking at the financials of RKT I really think that the most conservative number it could call home given its PE compared to the mortgage market is $25 at the lowest. Thats still $3 higher than the price today.  That $1 payout is all a matter of how low you get in and how long you plan to play most definitely. I personally see it maintaining $30 until mortgage interest rates weigh on that whole industry for the next 1-2 years. After that I do see them capturing more market shares because the mortgage industry is still stuck in the glory days of the 90s-early 2000s it seems. Bro you need to relax. I was kind of on your side at first like a couple days ago maybe even. Your posts are kind of obnoxious and you're just going a little too hard at it.  Other people's posts are clearly making it through. So take a step back and ask yourself what are you doing and then change that. It's not inherently RKT. You should remove your little shitty intro on this post No wonder I always see ppl around reddit complaining about shitty rates from RKT I have some RKT shares . However the complicated 8% ownership structure stop.me from buying more. There’s a whole sub for RKT bag holders lol I used ER instead of EPS (Earnings per share). The average multiple for the financial sector as of 02/26 was 12.17. RKT's EPS for 2020 was 4.08 × 12.17 = $49.65 = Undervalued vs Financial Sector(which includes more than just bank) by about 56%. This stock would need to more than double (and would without heavy short interest) to be fairly valued. The SI holding it down has kept retail away due to the early burn and FOMO. RKT is currently being valued as a boring bank stock. Jay has been preaching all the words of being a Fintech company. They are investing heavily into their platform in multiple different avenues to become the Amazon of their industry. RKT will be a triple digit stock, no doubt in my mind. Just look at current Fintech valuations and SP. This is a truly and undervalued gem that will eventually blast off and finally be adopted as a tech monster! I hope you all can see the value and pile on to ride out this future journey of fortune!!🤑😎👌 I am not following you. Shorting decreases a stocks price, so you're kind of defeating your own point. All I was saying above was that $RKT is down for the same reason the rest of the entire market is down, only it's down less. I’ve sold off basically everything but the meme stock that I like. Waiting for a correction, then going balls deep back into YSG/TSLA/NIO/NIU and maybe RKT/PLTR later. RKT 🚀 RKT to 💯🎯🚀 RKT is the meme stock that I can step away from for a week and see a 5 cent delta. It's about as boring as can be but man I love those earnings. Unfortunately I only have 200 shares. Shorts, lots of them, apart borrowing shares for shorts I don’t think it’s possible to go above 100%.   GME mutual fund ownership is 3192 %, AMC at 3000% ish, PLTR at 182%, BA at 1700% since everyone expect it to sink after the lost motor.  What is going on right now is absolutely crazy. I’m thinking about getting in RKT and a few others. The Post Earnings RKT Play - ROCKET TO THE MOON (Tendie Time) **TL;DR RKT is going to bull run all the way to the 9th March after its beautiful earnings and it's time to burn some shorts.**  Yesterday pre-earnings I posted some [DD](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsdpuz/rkt_to_the_moon_dd_and_short_squeeze_opportunity/) on why RKT (Rocket Companies) was a buy. I was right, the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10% from highs of a 20% gain during the day. To someone that has not followed RKT this may seem like a missed opportunity. WRONG. Welcome to the Amazon of the Finance World (well near enough).  Rocket by all traditional measures should've risen to $25 (previous close of $19.90) minimum today. Their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past. Practically since the IPO institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls, some covered, some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between $19 and $21 or to average down from a bag holding position above. These players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase (a potential gamma squeeze if it did so). Hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below $22.  **Next week, things start to change...**  But before that let's just go over the insane earnings they just report:  1. **EPS $1.09** (analyst prediction $0.87) an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from $754 million to $2.84 billion. 2. A **special dividend of $1.11** per share to Class A common stock holders on March 9th (note this is important autists). 3. **Partnerships with a multitude of companies including JP Morgan**. 4. Stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended. 5. There's more little nuggets but that's enough for ape brain to take in.  **So what happens next week?**  Firstly the dividend at current stock price is just over **5% yield**. An insane amount. This provides a catalyst for the price in two ways. Firstly, who doesn't want any easy 5% return? This is hardly priced in let's be realistic. These earnings give RKT as **PE of 5**. Way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around **3 to 4 times too small** if you consider them a Fintech.  More importantly, let's have a look at RKT's **short interest**. It lies somewhere between 35% and 40%. Now let's be clear this isn't going to be a Reddit, retail investor driven **short squeeze**, RKT has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million BUT if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure. Shorts have to pay the dividend - an instant 5% loss is not a good look and who knows if there'll be more to come in later earnings. With call holders less in the equation, the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies. It's time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the IPO.  Everyone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover, and 40% of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me. A huge difference between RKT and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above $30 indefinitely (or higher). Shorts don't like to be stuck indefinitely losing, unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse - not that they will unless you all have weak hands. Expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around $30+ to drive the price up more.  With all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of March. I have a genuine PT after that earnings of $40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ship's favour the moon is only the beginning. This Rocket is going up Uranus like your wife's boyfriend's is up hers.  Rocket is recruiting diamond hands, I am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10% profit BUT autists and apes we can get 100%, 200% or more!  RKT closed at $21.85 today. It is my firm believe RKT is a **brilliant buy** after these earnings under $24 and if the bull run starts all the way to $30. Management want these shorts out and that's good enough for me, the CEO laughed at the shorts on CNBC.  I am willing to put my money where my mouth is as I averaged up from $30 per cent equivalent CfD contracts at $20.30 to $41 per cent equivalent at $20.91.  In other words get us to $46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade. These values are actually GBP but I presumed you only know dollar due to autism.  **I just like the stock. So buy shares, squeeze shorts.**  **RKT TO THE MOON!**  [Earnings Call Transcript](https: www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/)  EDIT: VERY IMPORTANT POINT - some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95% is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion not far off GME.

But heads up, JP Morgan recently dumped 92% of their shares.    [RKT Institutional Ownership - Rocket Companies Inc Stock (fintel.io)](https: fintel.io/so/us/rkt) RKT actual SI% is near 70%. Cost to borrow is over 30 and DTC is at 7.8. Shorts got in looking for bad earnings and now they are holding their breath on a stock that analysts have now reversed their ratings on. Do your own DD but high SI along with special dividend and power earnings spells at least a $24-$33 price already built in in next two weeks. Oh fuck...u apes leave RKT alone...this shit is gonna tank now...fml RKT is my largest holdings. 20,000 shares long and strong holding for years or $200/share what ever comes first. Love the RKT!!! I think the market in general just doesn't like the mortgage business since 2008 the mortgage companies went tits up.  But, imo this blind dislike is silly when you consider how long companies like countrywide were printing money.  Tl;dr hedgies hate mortgages, which makes me love RKT. From the street insider.com       Rocket Companies (NYSE: RKT) declared a special dividend of $1.11 per share.  The dividend will be payable on March 23, 2021, to stockholders of record on March 9, 2021, with an ex-dividend date of March 8, 2021. Yes.  Mortgage everything on RKT Funny thing though, 2008 was good for RKT, while other mortgage originators were dying off, RKT (Then Quicken Loans) was expanding.  They didn't go for the quick buck and scam people with the sub-prime mortgages.  They looked to the future and that's how they eventually became #1.  The next downturn in the housing market will just see a much larger RKT gobble up a much larger chunk of market share. Who else is ready for the RKT ride? RKT to 💯🎯🚀 RKT Yolo update - end of month. 75% shorted. Dividend lock in on March 9. Fuel loaded 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 shorts better cover or they’ll be paying extra to their lenders Courtesy of u/brawnerboy  I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https: www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)  If you haven't already, you should read it.  Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.

It’s true Rocket Auto hasn’t launched *publicly* but it doesn’t mean Rocket Auto hasn’t launched. **Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales, marketing and customer service.** Rocket even powers their e-commerce platform. They literally run every part of Vroom’s business except for the delivery of the vehicle.  If you look at VROOM’s 10Q, you’ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4-year agreement with VRM. The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8,641,914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four-year period, in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket’s e-commerce platform. That’s $430M worth of shares. Let’s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom (2015) so we don’t even know how much he already owns. See section of Vroom’s 10Q below:  *Paragraph in VRM 10Q: “On May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Rocket”) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the “Rocket Auto” brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the “RA Agreement”).

The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company’s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement.* ***The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period*** *based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.”*  As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter…and **what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday’s earnings report?** A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don’t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted.  I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom – why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn’t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it’s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly.  **Why is used car sales good for Rocket?**  Because Data, Data, Data.  Rocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans  Rocket can very easily have access to half of America’s homeowners credit reports by 2030 – The jackpot of consumer data.  What does a credit report tell you? **It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off.** This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform.  Look at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana’s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket’s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket’s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus – to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world’s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate.  Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes **1 million decisions per day** and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions.  Not to mention, ***Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales***\*\*.\*\* We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep – and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana’s presence.  **Rocket Homes:**  *WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW:*  Dear smooth brain, please download “Rocket Homes” on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow.  I’ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won’t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes.  I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket’s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial).  Not going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B – A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET’s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED.  **Rocket’s expansion internationally:**  Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B.  We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country.  Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket’s Lendesk fits the Bill.  Unfortunately these dumbass mods won’t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/) Link below:  [https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  This international expansion (along with Rocket’s other ancillary businesses) highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started.  **Short Squeeze**  Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares – but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares.  Despite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market.  To combat this unnecessary shorting, **Rocket announced a $1B buyback**; currently their float is $2B.  First off, who even announces a buyback when they’ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of.  Rocket’s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday’s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover?  Initially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn’t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn’t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August – that’s how much he believes in this company.  Gilbert has a big ego – so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron’s Fathead to Benedict Arnold’s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America’s biggest traitor*. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below:  [https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/](https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/)  This was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect.  Just like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I’m sure he’s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close).  Fun fact – even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James’ departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship… Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000](https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000)  **But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren’t they buying back shares at these these levels?**  Answer: because they likely can’t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain.  According to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading.  What is material information? Material information is any information that hasn’t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released.  What is Rocket's ""non-public material information"":  * The announcement of Rocket’s big, new financial partner * The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto  This information is likely to be made public on Thursday’s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float. And to put fuel on the fire, Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back, that is, if there are any shares left for purchase.  Gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs, imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into.  Say it with me now: Rocket Bears are Fucked.  TDLR: this doesn’t contain even a fraction of the information in this DD part three (or DD part one and two) but this dude does a good job summarizing RKT’s situation.

FV,89,10497," People actually wanna have millions to showboat to others. Hell, if I ever got as rich as DFV I'd disappear off the face of the planet. Fuck this dog eat dog world. I'd go somewhere where I could see the sunrise and sunset. My, myself, and I. 😔 The path of the retard is beset on all sides by the inequities of paper hands and the tyranny of hedge funds. Blessed is DFV who, in the name of charity and value plays, shepherds GME through the valley of darkness, for he truly is an autist and is the finder of lost tendies. And I will strike down upon the dip with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my tendies. And you will know I am an ape when I lay my diamond hands upon you.  Ezekiel 25:17 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 You mean you asked DFV if you should buy or sell, according to the billionaires That's some DFV style DD, I approve I am not a cat but DFV has spoken. “Live on CNBC!  DFV states “I am not a cat”, but we have video evidence showing otherwise...” DFV may not be a cat, but that cat is certainly his spirit animal Is this the cat DFV was talking about? Cat says buy DFV = ROARING KITTY cat likes stock ROARING KITTY LIKES STOCK I LIKE STOCK He is in trouble if he uses DFV defense though...  ""I am not a cat!"" The Rock to be casted as DFV confirmed So Dwain Johnson is gonna play DFV in the dramatisation of this? DFV has not ONCE mentioned this being about hedge funds. Idk why you guys think that’s his goal. He was doing this ages ago because he thought gme was undervalued. Not for a short squeeze. He doesn’t care about hedge fund shit. He was in it to make money. It’s all the bagholders that made it some movement. To justify losses. I googled DFV in various ways; wasn't getting results, so I asked. But yeah, I'll look up DeepFuckingValue I’ve seen outrageous posts and bets here recently, and people have lost money because they have no idea what they are doing. So, I’m just going to leave this here and post it again, or a long version throughout the week to lower this madness and save people from losing money. I honestly hope newcomers see this...  Tl;dr: STOP OVERTHINKING  Treat GME like a meme stock and buy on the dip. If you buy options, set the expiration for end of month/April. Doesn’t matter what the strike price is because of IV Crush. You can sell anytime without effecting the cause (always pay yourself, keeps your head clear). If you sell before stimmies, buy back in. Gamma is pending.   Longer version:  There will be a squeeze and a gamma squeeze this month (March). Follow the money/word of mouth. The real catalysts are social media and upcoming stimulus.   GME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks. It’s abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn’t matter what your strike price is. All that matters is the expiration. Set longer expirations for your calls/puts so you can sell whenever you feel like paying yourself and buy the shares to support the cause.   GME being a meme is not a bad thing. In fact, it’s why we can do this. You don’t need an over complicated strategy to make profit here. The stock will rise and gamma when the little people are given 600 billion dollars to invest. Hedge funds know this and will use this as the opportunity to win the war. This isn’t new information. This has been in play since January, possibly even before. Why did DFV set his calls to expire in April? Why are hedgies repositioning themselves? Why did shorties call foul play against us in January? Play it smart and safe and you won’t lose a dime and will make unbelievable profits.    Remember that we are small fish in a gigantic pond that has existed even before DFV decides to make his move. I can elaborate on this later. While we may be small fish, the great equalizer is the stimulus. Some of you don’t remember this: but shorties and hedgers cries foul play, blaming the government for giving people the power to take their profits because the stimulus gave millions of people the same buying power as hedge funds. Fueled by word of mouth, which travels at the speed of light because of social media, it created an explosion that they could not control, so they shut down the game. It will happen again.   I think people are overthinking this and coming up with convoluted plans, when all you have to do is buy and hold. Sell your options, but hold your shares. Rinse and repeat. It’s what hedge funds are doing. It’s all there if you look at the charts AND the options. Look at the whole picture and follow the money.   Cash app finally added GameStop to purchase, meaning ANYBODY can buy the stock, AND the the stimulus is on its way. Put it together. Don’t look for a made up catalyst. It’s right there in front of all of us. It happens with hertz, and it happened in January. Don’t underestimate the power of the Apes and social media.   I left a lot of things unexplained but you get the picture. Also, for those of you who are spreading the word, keep it up and ramp it up before the stimmies drop. Doing God’s work (not religious just an expression). I’ll see you all in Andromeda (galaxy far away because this is going intergalactic).   This is just my opinion, trying to save lives not give financial advise. If it sounds this way that’s interpretation.   I eat crayons and huff gas fumes for fun!  I hope all newcomers see this...  Edit: thank you all so much! I am replying to you Damn apes as fast as I can! Am I officially an Ape now? I love you guys and want ALL OF US to prosper! I left some things out like how “GameStop is a cow that produces infinite milk and that’s why shorties keep coming back to ‘squeeze’” but I thought it was implied lol my B. I was planning on making a more in-depth version of this post soon though!  Whenever you are confused and dissuaded by all the misinformation, come back here or speak my name. I’ll be there to put you back on the right path. DFV has had the April calls for at least 6 months. I don’t think he knew anything magical about the macro economy would happen on or before this date (eg, stimulus, etc). He was making a play through Q4 earnings announcement is my guess. DFV didn't buy his calls for April based on this though... He bought his calls long before all this shit started hitting the fan. Time to learn about options then.   Anybody knows what options did DFV bought? I think you are focused too much on the shorts and not on the hedge funds who are also betting with us (not for the cause, but because they have been squeezing GameStop long before DFV got involved). GME is a meme stock. It does not operate the normal stocks do. It’s demand randomly surpasses its supply and that’s what causes spikes. What will cause the squeeze is the enormous demand pending after mid March while the stock is STILL shorted. Let me put it this was way:  You are a hedge fund and shorted gme. You are also a hedge fund and bought calls knowing the stock will rise because of a sudden movement that is driving demand through the roof. You wager that you can make money on the rise AND the dip this way. Why else do you think the the hedges jumped back in? GameStop is the company that produces infinite milk as long as you “squeeze” the udders (pun intended). They have been doing this for years. It won’t stop till the gamma squeeze happens.   I’m not telling you to buy the stock. I’m just explaining in simple terms why you SHOULD. :) But did CashApp know about the 2021 stimulus in Feb 2020??   Really?  DFV bought 1000 April 2021 calls sometime during the month of Feb of 2020 as best I can tell - before anyone knew the extent of COVID.  So he likely had no clue about stimulus when he placed that bet.  That's all I'm saying.  It looks like a good bet (for him, not suggesting anyone else should take that bet now) but my conclusion based on the data is that it had NOTHING to do with the stimulus.  Go look at his YOLO post history and confirm for yourself.  Good luck, friend.  Hope your strategy plays out for you. DFV changed his username *again* plot twist: its DFV smurf account DFV didn’t buy deep OTM call options expiring a week from purchase. This is closer to an old school WSB, minus the earnings, FD YOLO play. This dudes trying to be DFV in a week lol not 2 years like the real deal would be awesome if these hit though reminds me of the pre split Tesla options guy if these hit Powered by DFV rocket fuel If that's the case I'm concern for DFV as he look alot like vlad Taking profits by trimming on the way up is not paper handing. There is nothing wrong with trimming, DFV stated this multiple times in his streams. Christ you guys need to actually make some money at some point. DFV has his own company now? I've commented this before.  I think the powers that be should tap him, Paul Dano, to play both Vlad and DFV in the movie. Even if DFV looses all his money he has a new job 🚀🚀🚀 Our floor is 38.50 where DFV and other apes are holding. They can’t short harder than that due to shear fundamentals of the company. We’d be buying at a discount by then. Not to mention our other advantage. They have to pay interest, we don’t. For as long as they hold they bleed But DFV is our own whale or at least our main man with a dick the size that of a whale's! There’s no shame in getting your initial out and HODLing with house money. DFV did some profit taking and re-invested at a dip. I got my initial out, and now I’m set up to hold forever and ever (and re-up on the dip). While it may give an opportunity to cover for some shorts, it ultimately sets up a more reliable and sustainable hold position for me as I have zero reason to paper-hand the house money now.  30@57.72, I’m not a professional investor But I mean, I’m not an educated investor but when I look at the numbers, assuming they are trust worthy, and with big players like DFV and Elon getting involved, it appears that it has a clear path to roughly $500 at some point. Is it just a pure gamble? Or is it we are sitting on a 20 at the Blackjack table? I love how /DFV looks like VLAD's evil smarter twin. He singlehanded drilled his ass 10 inches wide bleeding like a river. SOON TO THE MOON I just realized what a through and through wholesome individuum DFV is.The way he says ""Cheeeeers everybody"" just speaks volumes on how he just wants everyone on this planet to be happy idk why. Had to upvote for that DFV laugh. Fuck, what a chad. Me dreaming of Musk and DFV together in a collab video 🍾 Thanks for making it hahah dude DFV face at the end on the right lol shit got me the second time around I'm so glad DFV was up there waiting for you When there will be actual movie? So we can see DFV at Oscars! Kinda a joke kinda not, but at what point would wsb become majority share holders and just be able to fore this guy and place DFV in his place Don’t worry DFV made multiplies of that Guys... You probably now OWN this company with all your stocks. YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT GOES ON. Just have an extraordinary annual meeting. Hell. Nominate u/DFV as chairman of the board if you want. You literally have the power to do it. DFV would have got more It’s literally who you know with these guys. He got a bonus bc shorts had to cover. Guess what, his bonus would be twice the size if DFV was said to have owned 50,000 shares of it. Why would DFV buy 50k more shares if he also didn't think it would moon? He could've cashed out and been set for life, never logged on to reddit ever again, and invested in nice dividend yielding etfs and lived like a KING. IF HES STILL IN, IM STILL IN! DFV and co aren’t deities. They could be wrong. They could also be right, but don’t pretend like this has to happen just because some people are still in.  The history of Wall Street is riddled with investors who were hot shit until they royally fucked up. You bet your ass I'm buying more. After not buying when DFV doubled down and seeing it rocket last week, I'm not making that mistake twice. Next sweet lil' dip I'm buying the SHIT out of it. when DFV double down i told my SO that I was gonna yolo 3k. I ended up buying 500 worth. regret is real , not gonna make the same mistake again. will load up if dips for sure.  How did your retaarded ass pull that PFV (perfect fucking video off)?? I tell ya, I'm impressed! You did a great job. Oh and yesterday I literally felt like I was in an MMA fight dream and there was 30 seconds left in the round and I was winning on the score cards. All I'd have to do is hold the other fighter off and I'd win! I bought 1 share at a time as fast as I could for the last 4-5 minutes at market value. I felt like what I did defended $8 bucks. Maybe it did, maybe it didn't. I managed to buy like 42 shares, one transaction at a time. When I saw $8.01, I celebrated and downed 2 banana's DFV wearing his suit from the SEC hearing I intend on watching the movie that releases when DFV sells his rights at a local AMC with the basket of tendies AMC recently advertised on twitter So here's a question that's been bugging me because like most here I'm new to all this craziness. The hedges have a finite amount of money and will be forced to pay a theoretically infinite amount to buy back shares. Who's to say that the hedges wouldn't go bankrupt covering shares from just a few major shareholders i.e DFV who owns atleast 100k and others who I'm sure own even more? Would most of us not just end up bag holding if that happens or how would this whole thing actually play out? Would we just have to choose a spot to jump off the train and hope we weren't too late to make tendies and not so early that we miss out on massive gains? Yes!! I have never bought a single stock. I'm a boring 401k Gen-X dude. But, this thing has just totally caught my attention. I was outraged to see DFV investigated or even implied he had done something wrong. Our system is so corrupt. Thank you for your original post. I'm a car guy and had never understood the VW/Porsche deal. What a bunch of nonsense. Of course it matters whether you buy in at a lower or at a higher price and of course there are ways to make educated predictions about where the price will bottom out. Do you believe that DFV timed the dip perfectly for his second buy-in by chance? I found the perfect entry point at 300, then again at 165... and lost it all to stop loss when it dipped below 80.    When DFV bought in at 40 again, that was the right time.  Trying to hop on the rocket as it's taking off is a bad idea.  This is my 60 thousand dollar lesson that I share for you.  Get it while it's on the ground.   Don't be a paper hand bitch like me.  I lost 10 years of savings and can't get back on the rocket now. The best entry point was when DFV bought in. The perfect entry point is whenever DFV buys. When was the perfect time to buy GME? When all the paper handed fools gave up on it. Bought 45 shares @$44.39 💎🙌🏼🚀 If you didn’t buy in after DFV doubled down, you’re a true retard 🦍 If DFV didn't buy 50,000 @ 38 the stock would've continued to decline. DFV was the catalyst.   But honestly, if the Hedgies push to 50. They're all fucked cause we're in this bitch. AND WE AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.    BUY & HOLD FELLOW RETARDS 💎✊🚀🚀 lots of people including myself bought around 40-55 just because we heard DFV bought 50,000 more. True Legend. Shouldn’t DFV be yoda lol I seriously wonder if I should make a post to clear up the air on this because people are WAY overthinking this causing very foolish and brash bets that seem ludicrous to me. I agree with you on the mini squeeze, but I think Wednesday we may see a big jump and then a plummet by Friday. This isn’t anything new though. GME was being manipulated this way long before DFV jumped in. It’s honestly a cow that theoretically can produce infinite milk and will continue to be shorted until the gamma squeeze happens. If DFV is holding, and you're holding, I am definitely holding.  I like the stock.  $145 for 17 shares, not much, but my commitment to you apes out there! I think Bruce is right; I think the hedge funds that were short, scrambled to stop the bleed. They ran to Chicago market makers, bought deep ITM call options that expired on 2-26, at various price points, 40,45,50, etc. enough contracts to not only cover their shorts, but buy excess, sell for profit on the way back up. Stock hits 200, 250, 300, whatever, they profit off each sale. They could then turn around and short it again, and run to Chicago if needed to buy call options again. They still make their money. However, it’s now the Chicago marker makers that are on the hook for those naked call option shares.  I’m just a new, smooth brained ape, but it made total sense to me. Bruce and DFV have been right all along. This ape trusts 💎🤲 I don’t have any tattoos but when I become a millionaire and I need 10k , then I will get a DFV his face tattoo on my arm . I am so excited to reed your answers I'd be squirting Hershy's in my diaper watching those wins and losses. Someone correct me or explain something to me please. When DFV (Deep fucking value) said that he saw the stock being worth $20-$25 and then saw the stonk go into the hundred's, why wouldn't he sell? I know, he has diamond balls and piercing blue eyes and likes the stonk. But that was $400 plus over his evaluation. Why hold your April 26th call options when they were worth way more . Why watch your account go from 48 mil to 18 mil without taking profit. Did he take profit? If anyone knows, I'm ears. Don't get me wrong, the guy can fuck my wife anytime he wants while you guys watch because his name is deep fucking value and he has an Iron sword, but holding all the way down sounds like he's missing a few chromosomes. I would love to see DFV on the board - he is exactly the type of person that should be! He will be the next generations Jim Kramer if he wants...Mad Money be gone, enter DFV Money!!!   I’d watch it.... DFV 2024 I will start by stating that my retard to autist ratio is 420:69 so take anything with a grain of crayon shavings washed down with Capri-Sun.  We could be in for an interesting week ahead of us. There is already plenty of DD about GME and I would much rather look at some numbers than someone trying to decode tweets by DFV or try and figure out what the Hedgies are up to. I was much more interested in the volume that we have seen the last week and decided to present to you volume from 1/20-1/27 and volume from 2/23-2/26.   &#x200B;  |Date|Open|Close|Volume| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Wednesday 1/20|37.37|39.12|33,471,790| |Thursday 1/21|39.23|43.03|57,079,750| |Friday 1/22|43.59|65.01|197,157,900| |Monday 1/25|96.73|76.79|177,847,000| |Tuesday 1/26|88.56|147.98|178,588,000| |Wednesday 1/27|354.83|347.51|93,396,670|  &#x200B;  |Date|Open|Close|Volume| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Tuesday 2/23|44.97|44.97|7,565,215| |Wednesday 2/24|44.70|91.71|83,111,740| |Thursday 2/25|169.56|108.73|150,308,800| |Friday 2/26|117.46|101.74|92,194,150| |Monday 3/01|TBD|TBD|TBD| |Tuesday 3/02|TBD|TBD|TBD|  &#x200B;  This Does not mean that the upcoming price will skyrocket like it did in January. It is only a comparison of the volume with the open and closing prices.   This is also not financial advice and I am not telling you to buy, sell or hold.   To any journalists/reporters that reads these threads and wants to claim that this price movement is due to a bunch of retail investors I would like to respond with a healthy FUCK YOU and that you should know better that the amount of volume that is happening is not because of the retards here.   Data pulled from:  [GameStop Corporation Common Stock (GME) Historical Data | Nasdaq](https: www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical) Honeslty his DFV coded tweets made me think of using DQ ice cream swirls as a code word for hundies, my brain works in weird ways sometimes 🤔 This company needs to produce real results. All of this is just speculation.      I think $40 was a great price for the company, and DFV knows that. Now at $100+ it's in over-valued territory again. They have a lot of work to do, a lot to prove, and so if you are trying to determine the fundamental value then it is not yet $100.      The price is where it is because of MANY other factors, mostly supply and demand, a short float, aggressive short positions, aggressive long positions. Lots of money being made. This thing could just as easily go back to $500 for a day before crashing again.      At this point if you bought at $40 this is an investment. Sit back and check back in a year.     If you are a TRADER then you can buy at any price and make money, if you're lucky. If you buy at $100 and sell at $150. Amazing 50% return. But, most people are going to be greedy, hold on too long, not have any stop-losses and watch their 10 minute gain of 1000% become 20% become -25%. This is because most people, new retail investors, don't have the experience yet to realize the price movements of GME are not typical, not normal and people trade an entire year just to get 18% on their money, and consider that good. So if you are up 20%... please realize that's fantastic. Bruce is great very relaxing voice during trading hours. u/heyitspixel is putting out some really solid DD. DFV with updates to keep the faith. Imagine we pooled our shares together to nominate DFV for a board position 😂😂😂 Idk maybe he selling April 1 calls lol  Edit: why not get 4/16 instead..i been hearing DFV is in that one forgot strike tho... We can't always count on DFV or a  tweet from Elon or Choen.   Is Gamestop a meme stock?   So ... let's MEME!  Let's bring this beautiful stock to $ 1000 by our own! We have the diamond hands, DFV has the diamond bands Does anyone know what broker apps/programs DFV uses? [https: twitter.com/MitchNicholsJr/status/1365769611321434118?s=20](https: twitter.com/MitchNicholsJr/status/1365769611321434118?s=20)     If DFV sees this, its Game over on twitter lmao After the first godly squeeze in January and the artificial fall, I and I’m sure many other apes felt that we lost the fight (war or whatever you want to call it). A few weeks go by and the stock keeps falling slowly but surely which led the majority if us to believe it is a thing of the past. Many analysis and DDs and news showed that shorting went down to 60% (from over 100%) so everything seemed negative for us average rookie investors (which im sure is the majority). Keeping in mind I am now bag holding my 87% loss and thinking it is not even worth selling anymore so might as well forget it about it (diamond hands but it was very sad hands).  Moving to the present, all the ape shit that happened starting with the hearing, DFV doubling down and stock rocketing. I averaged down to 130$ from 270$, which was an easy decision for me so I’m thinking it was the same for people in my position.  I was watching the stock yesterday at 101$ and the ask was soooo not random as notmally it is because they were thousands of calls in 101.xxx which is what I guess what reddit calls a ladder attack. And the shares being borrowed and now it makes sense to me what they are doing!!! Which im sure everyone like myself with a smooth brain finally understand on some level the game!!!  So now I’m thinking since I have 5 times bigger bag at 130$ average, and other apes that did the same thing own more stocks of GME, plus we are optimistic now. As a result this means we will be holding the line stronger than the first time, so it shouldn’t go below the 45$ margin which it was at in the weeks after the first fall.  P.S. this is obviously not financial advice, and obviously you could tell I’m so bad at stock analysis and math. This is just how I am feeling right now and what my smooth brain concluded.  Anyone else feels the same way? Squazozzle update 2/26: Citadelvin tried so hard today. DFV ain't fuckin' leaving and neither are we! Drive it to $40 again, I beg you. BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon.  HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK. Need DFV to buy some🌙🌙🌙 I genuinely wanna know. Even right now it's easy to tell they are already scheming along with RH to pull some illegal shit right on our faces since they got away with it the first time. Are they actually stupid to just lose to us ""dumb money""?   I know for a fact that once the gamma squeeze happens and they shut down WSB and halt trading, alot of the new retarded apes here will just panic sell since I doubt most of the 6+ million people that joined here even knows how shorting and gamma squeeze works.  I don't wanna sound pessimistic, I just wanna hear if we have a chance to pull out a miracle, actually reach 1000 per share, make DFV a goddamn trillionaire, build a city on the moon and ultimately fuck them sideways and over.  Edit: Thank you to all you big brained apes🦍 for taking your time to share your knowledge upon some pleb! I'm new to all of this and I'm trying to learn as much as I can. I am grateful to be making history with you guys Google says that gme has a float of 45m. There are 9m wsb members. If every 💎👐 here has an average of 5 shares that would be the entire float. I have seen people posting about holding thousands of shares. DFV has 100k shares. I have a couple of friends that have 25 shares a piece. Will someone explain how the hfs could short this stock at 10% and even have a chance?   I think if we hold we're going to the🌑?  Positions: 40 shares of gme @less than the peak and higher than the low points.  Tldr: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  Edit: I didn't mean this to be a roll call of sorts, but by all means, let's get an idea of how many shares we all have here. Fellow retards, I might be retarded but I'm just thinking about the future of GME. Ryan Cohen and team turned Chewy into a company worth 40 Billion. Currently trading at 103 a share. Chewy does not have a ton of assets its just an online e-commerce pet store. He beat Amazon out to become the primary pet supply online retailer.  GME actually has real assets, stores all across the country. Imagine what he could do with that. GME 3.8B market cap is absolutely undervalued.  Ryan Cohen saw an opportunity with gamestop, to take a dying company and turn it around doing what he ALREADY KNOWS HOW TO DO.  In short, I like the stock. If I can make some money on a squeeze I'm happy - if somehow things don't work out with a squeeze I'm happy to hold. I'm looking at bringing my average down soon and holding unless this thing pops off to the 1000s.  DFV is a very smart man.   Pos: 46 GME @ 133 1. Warchest: Raise some fucking capital at these prices for fucks sake, the tendies are there take them.  2. Get into digital game purchases, think Steam / GMG / GOG / Humble Bundle. Purchasing a company like Green Man Gaming, GOG, Humble would help catapult them into space.  3. Release a special edition WSB Funko Pop with Diamond Hands and sell it for $42.69 4. Be the only online retailer that can properly handle the scalpers and let me get a PS5 / RTX 3080 etc.. honestly putting engineering resources into this is worth it for customer loyalty.  5. Social Club for Apes: Support local eSports, have local meetups, and embrace the community. Think along the lines of old-school comic book stores / DnD night.   6. Old game bundles, new game bundles, rare games, special edition hard copies of digital-only games tie it into local store inventory and... (see #7)  7. Use the stores like mini distribution centers they are everywhere .. close that last-mile gap and give Amazon a run for its money. if Dominos can get me a Pizza in 30min you can have one employee driving around dropping off local orders.  8. Make the website not suck 9. Make the mobile app not suck 10. Announce DFV as a boardmember"
ITM,85,39104," The max pain value on GME is consistently above 50 for the next 2 months. I see speculation that hedge funds actually drove the price up by purchasing way ITM call options that cover double or more than their short position.  This puts the bearish position in the options sellers hands.. and now they are short gamestop for a far greater amount than the hedge funds--potentially needing to purchase many more shares than are available.  It was pretty evident that this is a gamma squeeze regardless, so whether or not it was driven by hedge funds switching to long positions is irrelevant.  This stock ain't done by a long shot. I'm starting to this that the GME meme stock and the HF war is pretty much over and is a nice narrative.  The real war now is with HF and MM's as to who can make money and not get stuck holding the bag.  Retail that got stuck holding the last bag were those who FOMO'ed in and bought high sold low (this is the way).  Also this was a fight with WSB and Citron/Melvin which pretty much already played out.  From what I have read, and researched we know there is still a tonne of SI, and it increased the last two days, the price increase was from the FTD's early in the month, but now if the HF were smart they would have bought 2x their SI of ITM calls which expired on Friday.  This passes the bag off to the MM who sold them and they have  till the 19th to deliver (as we know every one will FTD esp if they were naked).  The HF's that were short just managed to kick this down the road to the MM's, and want to keep the price inflated and rise so they make even more money exiting their SI and going Long.  I could see the MM's who now have this hot potato try to trigger a call, and force all SI's to return stock before that point forcing a squeeze, and then tanking the stock before the 19th so that all those FTD's they need to return can be bought back on the cheap, now that SI's were forced to already buy, thus sticking the HF's with lots of pretty low priced stock.  This would also exclude the HF's from shorting again as the price rises if they are the ones required to buy.  Either way it's going to be an interesting month. That is the most expensive option and not necessary at all! But you can do it if you have the money because it is safer. Remember: time is key so set a longer expiration and sell whenever you feel like it for a profit. Buy some shares with a little of your earnings to give back to gme and support your fellow apes lol   If you don’t mind 300%-400% profit with a lower buy in, set the call higher in anticipation of it rising. For example: gme is 99.50$ per share;  You can buy calls less than 99.50$ and already be ITM (in the money) so once the stock RISES you can sell at anytime for profit because people will want your contract since it is now cheaper than buying a stock. They pay a premium which is your profits and you sell to them.   Or, you buy a $200 call which is OTM (out of money) which costs less because it’s more of a gamble. But, in the case of gme we know it’s going to moon, and so do many others so you buy this instead. As the stock rises, the premium goes up because people who didn’t buy are becoming more desperate to get in and are will to pay whatever you choose to sell it for because you know a squeeze is imminent. In this case your $200 call could be worth as much or MORE than what you paid because there is demand for it!  Tl;dr: if you have the money, buy calls at lower strikes and profit, if you have less buy OTM contracts and STILL make bank (maybe not as much, but still 5 figures plus per contract).   Phew. A little DD:  What is driving profits in options is IV (implied volatility) which is based off of supply and demand. What you are describing is closer to day trading when you buy a stock, hope it rises and sell at a profit. Options IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE (sorry I can’t stress that enough) are different, where the contract price is not directly based off of stock price, but demand for that particular contract. For example: when gme hit $170 last week; my 800$ call shot up to $4500 (I bought for 82$) AND my $5 put jumped %200.   The key here is my $800 call was worth more even though gme did not hit $800. That is because someone (maybe even hedges) wanted that contract and were bidding to buy it because they know a gamma is imminent and they want to buy it off me now as opposed to taking the risk that goes to $10000 (as an example).   Okay, simple version:  Due to high demand, and the belief and knowledge that a gamma is imminent, simply OWNING a call is now worth more than owning a share, because the the value of getting a contract early, which gives you right to buy a stock at a set price, is now worth more than buying a share and holding.   Here is why it is somewhat safer than owning shares (just an opinion): if you buy a share for $100 and the stock rises to $200 you make $100 profit. If you buy a contract, you can spend $100 and get access to a contract worth a hundred shares. If the stock goes to $200 you make $200x100 minus what you paid so $20000-$100 when you sell it. Crazy right?   When the stock goes down to $50, if you own the stock, you lose $50 in value, with options, if it expires you lose the $100 (so don’t diamond hand a contract). BUT you can sell the option off at ANYTIME and possibly make profits. It’s not possible anymore to buy a call for $100 because the squeeze is imminent unfortunately, but dig and find the cheapest options you can get your hands on.   This is a very rough, but basic understanding of options. It gets more complicated than that, but for the sake of gme this is the core fundamentals of how I made so much money off of a single squeeze and how you can too!  Wow I wrote more than I wanted too! I’m sorry lol Wouldn’t that be $80,000 to exercise the option if it’s goes ITM?  Nobody will want that...  maybe I’m wrong though.  Serious buyer would purchase $80k in shares now. Doesn't Gamma Squeeze require lots of ITM calls? This same argument probably applied when you bought, but right now you can get that 800c for $2.13.  Or a 500C for $3.  If it reached $800, you would have $300 more value per contract (although 2/3 as many contracts for the same buy-in).  And a far better (but still miniscule) chance of closing ITM. dude it doesn’t have to be ITM. as long as gme rises a decent % on monday he can still sell for a profit. I wouldn’t hold longer than Monday though He bought calls, he can't lose more than he already paid for them, which was around $25,000.  That money is already in the hands of whoever sold the calls.  RH won't let them expire in the money if you don't have the cash to exercise, so they will close them out on the expiration day for him, and he'll get a handsome premium if they're ITM at that time.  If they expire worthless (okay, WHEN), this idiot gets nothing and owes nothing more. Actually if people bought a shitload of options close to ITM then it may have a chance with the combination of a gamma squeeze coupled with a short squeeze. The volume vs float vs amount of SI is what hasn’t made sense to me since the big January move. What’s stopping hedge funds from exercising ITM calls (at 2x their short position) at a strike well below market thereby covering their short and taking a long position? In this scenario, the market makers in Chicago would be the ones scrambling to find shares to deliver, not the hedges. Anyone have thoughts on this possibility or is my brain as smooth as a marble?  My position: 500 shares of GME, holding till valhalla  (Reposted from another thread in hopes of discussion) The conditions have changed.     Originally the short positions were ALL under water. As the stock rose, say from $4 - $40, 140% of the float was short. If you were, for instance, 1,000,000 shares short at $4... You now were $40,000,000 upside down.      The HEAVY options activity back in January meant that call writers needed to hedge their risk as the price rose. There was one day it went from $20-$30 (50%) and then $30-$40. As that happened the likihood of those options expiring in the money became more realistic and the call writers needed to go get the shares in the case they had to deliver them to option owners. It literally was a BOMB waiting to explode.      Add in the WSB retail interest, the low float, and you had a catalyst for the stock to ONLY GO UP. Literally. An amazing historical moment in the history of finance.      After the wednesday when the price spiked from $60-$120 we saw a lot of profit taking and a lot of shorting at $120. This crashed the price to $60. This is the first moment that some new shorts entered at $120. Those positions were now healthy at $60.     Despite this, most shorts and most of the shorted float was still REALLY underwater big time. The big shorters were being margin called. As they were margin called they began selling blue-chips and their main holdings to get liquidity, this is why the market dipped big, and some shorters were margin called and liquidated- forced to close their positions.      So then the price went north of $120, now ALL shorters are under water again, and likely some started buying call options to hedge if this thing went up more. This actually exasperated the problem and made it more likely to go up due to call writers hedging.      So add in: 140% short float, margin calls, volatile stock, a lot of call options ITM, retail interest and WSB hype, PLUS big hedge funds were now entering the fun to make money on the squeeze.      POP... Price goes parabolic. Thursday night many shorts were looking at multi-billion dollar losses that they could not pay. The brokers would have had to pay those. So the brokers all decide to stop letting GME be bought. The shorters go to work Friday and sell, sell, sell... They drive the price down to $200 while opening new shorts at $450. Now a lot of shorts are in the green, but they haven't necessarily closed.   &#x200B;  Over the course of the next week people become despondent, fearful, and many sell. This gives shorts that opened at $450 downwards lots of liquidity to close shorts if they want, banking a killing. Those original shorts under $40 MAY have been closed as they were to average out with their other plays that worked. All in all most shorts are now hedged with long and short plays so nothing in particular can kill them. They are no longer cornered.      Since then the price has went UP and DOWN a lot. Every time it goes up it's a new opportunity for new short positions and new long positions. Every time it goes down it's an opportunity for shorts to close and bank profit and new longs to go in. The positions of every player now mean no one is overly compromised or stuck, there are just a lot of players involved with different profit targets. This means we shouldn't see any big margin calls or any forced covering of shares. These guys can wait it out, or they are hedging with their long calls if the price goes crazy stupid up. They are not idiots despite getting in this situation.      So while the GME price might be volatile and it might even get back to $500 the underlying infinite squeeze is no longer possible.      The only real way that the average retail guy can make money now is by being smart with your price entry and your price exit. Have a price target. Do you want to make 10%, 20%, 50%? Have that in mind and start taking profits once you are ahead. All that capital you will make you can use on your next trade.      Good luck to everyone, but do not buy into this situation as the conditions being the same as before- they are SO different... The market makers would buy the shares when the calls were purchased. If someone tried to buy 500,000 ITM calls I doubt the market makers would sell them. They don't want to be naked either. But then you think they will cover from the open market buys they have to do. Why not get ITM options and cover on Tuesday when those are delivered? When a market maker sells you a call, they simultaneously buy the stock at the same time (well, they’re supposed to). If they don’t, they have huge risk exposure and would have to buy to hedge as price increases. The amount they buy depends on volatility and changes day to day. That’s called delta neutral hedging. For simplicity, i used a 1:1 hedge, but in reality delta dictates the amount of shares for the hedge. When enough calls are bought, this drives buying. This is the gamma squeeze. Most options are closed before expiration. Traders generally have no interest in exercising options and owning shares. What people fail to understand, is that the market maker already purchased the shares that would have to be sold to the option buyer if they did choose to exercise (unless they’re naked selling, which would be bad business for them and could bankrupt them). If they didn’t, and they sold you naked calls, they put themselves in a bad spot. They’d be on the hook to buy the shares if the names calls skyrocket. That purchase happened already. At exercise, you simply take the shares from the market maker and pay him the strike price for them. They aren’t bought on the open market, driving up the share price. That’s not how it works. Now, the reason why you see such volatility on Friday’s, is because traders are closing out their trades. When they sell the calls back to close the trade, the market maker then sells their shares back to the open market, driving the price down (it’s not always “omg the shorts are doing a ladder attack!!”). Gamma squeeze happens at the time the calls are purchased, not at expiration. Nobody is buying 40 million shares Monday morning because options expired ITM. That’s not how it works. While you are in general correct, many people that sell super OTM calls don't properly hedge. If those calls expire ITM, they are required to buy the shares at whatever price the market sells them before they are obligated to deliver (see the IBKR chairman interview). This is likely what happened Monday 1/25 after a lot of unhedged calls expired ITM on 1/22. You are right. Tired of these threads and comments where people are saying, stock price is going up Monday or Tuesday because so and so options expired ITM and they have to buy the stock. What people fail to understand is there might be very few options that are exercised. Retail is in for premium mostly. With fast price movements delta does not always rise very quickly. I didn't check but there would be a lot of ITM options with delta less than 1. Only the very deep ITM will have delta 1 and only those would have been hedged 100%.  There is truth to the claim that some more buying needs to be done for the ITM options that expired (remaining delta basically).  We also need to look at the puts to see how much hedged covering etc is coming.  The folks on WSB aren't also considering the possibility that those who exercise might just sell the shares off too and cause a drop (seems unlikely if it is predominantly short covering strategy/diamond hands).  Didn't do the math though. Thank god, someone with sense. Even if investors do exercise ITM calls, the whole point is to sell the shares since market price > strike price. You would be correct, if delta was static, which it is not. Very OTM options with a delta under .1 get very ITM with a delta over .8, and a market maker needs to buy 70+ shares for each call he has sold to delta hedge.   TLDR: you are completely wrong and should delete this post. But the delta on OTM calls increases the closer they get to being ITM, so there is still some hedging that gets done after the sale IF the stock price starts to rise. If this was true then we wouldn't have gamma squeezes at all retard. You get a gamma squeeze when naked and way OTM calls are approaching ITM and the MMs have to buy shares up fast.  Even if they weren't naked the amount of shares they have to buy to compensate for a 100c written when the stock is worth less than 20 bucks is laughably low. Then when the price goes up they have to get more and more shares as well.   Basically, big unexpected swings in price are increased in momentum because the MMs have to buy shares as well. Hence, gamma squeeze.  Also, fwiw, MMs have NOT been properly accumulating shares because it's simply impossible to do so. If 100k contracts are expiring ITM that's ten MILLION shares that have to be accounted for every friday. There's only 5-15 million shares that are likely being traded as is. Why does no one understand delta hedging, Jesus. A call has a delta of .3? The market maker buys 30 shares and sells the call. What happens when the share price skyrockets and that OTM option is very ITM and now carries a delta of .8? Moron, i was explaining the foolery around all the incorrect gamma squeeze posts and nonsense about 30 million shares being purchased tomorrow because opinion expired ITM. This post wasn’t about short squeezes or face ripping rally’s. Yes, rebalancing happens every day. The point is that gamma squeeze has nothing to do with expiration day. What these people believe, is that all of those contracts equate to people buying the underlying shares because they expired ITM. Nobody is buying 30-40 million shares Monday morning because of fridays option expiration. Yes, delta hedges are rarely 1:1. It depends on volatility. No. That’s just for ATM options. Deep ITM options the delta’s not changing that much. OTM options it’s decreasing. ATM options yes it’s changing rapidly in both directions. Either way almost 100% of the shares that are needed for delivery (which is a very small amount) are bought by EOD and the rest in the AH. JAMIE pull up the call chain I’m on the toilet, problem for the contract writers is that the calls that went ITM last week were greater than the outstanding float especially with as many people HODLing as there are - thats the narrative you’ve gotta disprove not saying you can’t do that Yeah well he also said the whole system could have crashed if they didn’t stop buying because there were options for “150M shares” bought and only 50M shares out.  1) I checked. OI on 1/27 and 1/28 totaled 150k and 100K (10M and 15M shares) respectively. Which is a sht ton on a stock with 50M float but it’s not 3x the float 2) GME closed Friday 1/29 at $325 meaning a ton of options were ITM. And yet... here we still are. Did GME get massively squeezed the next week? No. Did the financial system crumble? No.  So what he said makes no sense. I get that he’s the founder of IBKR and worth $20B and I’m an idiot on Reddit but the way everyone bought his explanation is wild. Anyone stop to consider he had an interest in over exaggerating the situation to explain why IKBr couldn’t meet collateral requirements? They're called options.   There are basically two types of options, call options and put options.    Someone who has 100 shares on a stock can write 1 option. They are essentially betting their 100 shares that the price will go down, in which case they write a call option, or go up so they write a put option. They do this because they want to receive the premium payment, which is the cost to buy the contract off them, and the interest of holding the option, but not have the contract exercised and for it to expire worthless.    Options have a strike price, an end date, and a premium.    The strike price is the price at which the options writer is willing to sell their share prices at x 100 no matter what the current stock price is. Have a strike price of $2 but current stock price is $900? Well it doesn't matter because your option says you must sell the underlying shares at $2. The premium is the cost to buy the contract that gives the purchaser the choice to exercise that contract before the end date and buy or sell those underlying shares at the strike price. The premium takes into account things like difference between the current stock price and the strike price, called intrinsic value, takes into account time for the option to move in the money, and volatility, how swingy the stock is (which means it could be in the money or out of the money on the same day, which makes it more likely to net a profit) and that's called implied volatility.    Finally the options have an end date which is the date the buyer of the option has to exercise the option and get those 100 shares.    So the writer places their bet and along comes a WSB retard who says ""I see your call option and I'll take that bet"" because unlike the writer they think the stock price will rise and become ITM before the expiry date. So they purchase the option paying the premium x 100 (because there are 100 shares) and they hold but don't exercise the option. The writer gets the premium and the WSB retard gets the call option and waits.    Important to remember but 99% of options are not exercised but rather the option itself is traded between traders because the premium is often worth more than exercising the stock, paying the strike price, and then selling that stock at the current share price.    So if the contract becomes ITM the option becomes more valuable especially if it has more time on it because the chance of the stock moving in the direction required becomes more likely. If its netting huge profit the WSB retard sells that option to someone else (or holds) and nets the profit of the premium.   If the option gets to its agreed end date and expires WORTHLESS (or Out of the money) then the WSB retard has only lost his initial investment of the premium x 100 and the options writer (who wanted it to expire worthless) keeps his underlying stock to sell more options.    Note that options can be written without owning the underlying stock and these are called naked options, and its dangerous and stupid as fuck to do. Otherwise they're known as covered options because if for some reason the WSB retard wants to exercise the option then the writer can cover it and give them the 100 shares.    Call option buyers think the price will go up.    Put option buyers think the price will go down.     Call option writers think the price will go down.   Put option writers think the price will go up.    Put options are a little more complicated but the basic understanding is that the person who owns the put option has the right to sell 100 shares at the strike price.    That's the basics. Watch out for hedge funds ""Bull Trap"".  Hello friends,I just wanted to start by saying that I believe AMC & GME to both be under value at current prices and covid restrictions as well as NYC AMC opening back up.     NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01. The street sentiment is that AMC's price will be rising on Monday because the number of shares needed to brought to covered call options expired ITM. Fundamentally speaking that's how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn't make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF's decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.  Let just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF's ""Bull Trap"" so DO NOT FALL FOR IT & DO NOT SELL your shares, they will be able to use your shares to increase their short interest attacks and continues their ladder attack as well. We need to decrease the number of shares available in the float NOT increase it, by selling your shares you actually increasing it. It is very important to decrease the number of shares available in the float, that's how you trigger the ""Short Squeeze"". Why would the HF's buy shares from us at $100 if they can just buy it from the float at $10 or $15 to cover their short interest? Would you?  Example:  On January 27th AMC shares jumped 300% from $4.97 to $19.90 in one day. What was the reason behind this movement? AMC raising $900 million in the week before or the CEO announcing bankruptcy is off the table? the answer is none of it, it was the classic HF's bull trap, the hf was losing so much money in GameStop they needed to make money somewhere else, they intentionally put money into AMC to raise the price so retail investors would jump in at $14-$19 thinking the price would continue to go up. We all know what happened next, AMC tanked 65% the following day and people who brought AMC in at $14-$19 were trapped, hint the ""bull trap"".  I don't know what will happen on Monday, none of us do, hopefully, AMC price will rise to $10-$11, but do NOT FALL for the Bull Trap if the price rises to $15 or $20 if you sell your shares kiss goodbye to the short squeeze. Why do you think the HF vs retail investors were battling it out over 1 cent on Friday? Literally, it was down to the last minute. Those 120k+ call options were the catalyst that we needed to pressure the hf to buyback 10 of million of shares to cover their short interest.  ""(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.""  The approval of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine couldn't happen at a better time for AMC shareholders. The last time vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized back on November 7th AMC shoots up to 90% and closed over 50% for the day. All the weeds, airlines, hotels, and housing-related stocks were also up 20%-30% as well.  A new vaccine approved and millions of shares buyback, it will be very interesting how this played out on Monday.  Do NOT Sell my friends. I'm not sure why this guy got margin called with all the green in his account.. can someone explain? Value of shares and ITM calls should be sufficient collateral Long options (puts ands calls alike) have nothing to do with leverage and you cannot ever lose a cent over what you paid for the options. And if you meant exercising your ITM options might cost you more than you have in your account then you’re wrong again as 1) this is you realizing a profit, not losing money and 2) because of this your broker would sell your options for you (at a profit to you) if you don’t post the funds to take possession of the stock before expiry. I trade in my IRAs but its covered calls and ITM leaps and shit.  This is what I want to become. Your mention of loaning crazy DTI ratios in 2008 paralells the nearly 10 fold increase we've seen in GME shorting fees over the past week. It would seem that if your borrowing costs rose 10 fold you'd move to other investments... but we are seeing nearly the opposite.   My other scattered thoughts are below, curious to know what you think.   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In my opinion we do not currently have accurate short interest numbers, and perhaps never did considering all the potential ways to disguise it. As soon as hedgies knew we relied on that number, it ceased to become a reliable metric.   We all saw Melvin Capital lie about closing their positions pre-squeeze, we all saw CNBC try to divert us with SLV, and we all heard the IB president said if more of those calls were exercised on the 27th/28th it would've crashed everything. We didn't see short fees this high back then, nor did we see no available shares to short like we did on the 25th.  If this blows up we all know the effects it could have on the greater system, and for this reason hedgies are doubling down. In their mind they win both ways, either profiting off shorts by manipulating us all to sell, or getting bailed out by the govt if it all blows up.  Looking at upcoming option contracts: every single expiry has more puts than calls (OI).   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.  Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.  &#x200B;  Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. They tried this last week and failed, and the fight must continue if the squeeze is to be squoze. Watch Uncle Bruce’s video on shorts using ITM money call options to cover and exit their short positions, while they open new longs by forcing the Chicago options market makers to search for millions of  real shares that don’t exist. Hedge funds are shifting responsibilities to market makers by buying contracts for shares that are ITM. MMs are legally required to provide the shares. This is how HFs who had short positions are getting out of this hole. By forcing MMs to provide the shares they need to cover and also by going long. MMs are fucked because they sold naked contracts.  Tax payers may need to bail them out.... The amount of volume vs float is what hasn’t made sense to me since the big January move. What’s stopping hedge funds from exercising ITM calls (at 2x their short position) at a strike well below market thereby covering their short and taking a long position? In this scenario, the market makers in Chicago would be the ones scrambling to find shares to deliver, not the hedges. Anyone have thoughts on this possibility or is my brain as smooth as a marble?  My position: 500 shares of GME, holding till valhalla Can't the hedgies just go long as well and make money off our rocket by buying deep ITM calls, then short it back down again in an endless cycle? Saw a guy on YT saying the smart hedgies are covering their short positions by buying ITM call ladders near their break-even point. That way they don't give a shit what the price does, some MM in Chicago now has to find the shares to cover those calls instead of the Melvins having to buy shares to cover their shorts. Made my head explode. A lot of calls @ 8 closing ITM That's what I've been thinking as well but honestly, they've done so much illegal shit already I wouldn't be surprised if they end up changing the rules to favour themselves. They already did it, they said preventing buying was a way to prevent the destruction of the entire financial system. We were headed for infinite short squeeze up until 480ish. What I'm thinking is maybe some of them are covering with ITM options but if the whales like Melvin exercised that many contracts I would think that it would still squeeze to some extent. It shows how little we really know about the market's inner workings. They can cover naked shorts by buying way ITM call options. It’s actually not difficult for them to do. It becomes the option writers problem to locate shares, which actually might happen Monday. Look at the options contracts through your dealer. If there’s a lot of open interest for near ITM calls with not far off expirations, MM’s with buy into the market to cover those calls now, so they don’t get stuck having to cover those calls if those options get executed at those call prices.  Stock @ 10 - Call @ 20 that expires next week  Whales push share price up to 15  MM’s will cover those calls at 15 as risk management in case it shoots up to 20 and those options execute ITM  MM’s buying in becomes a self fulfilling prophecy that gamma squeezes the share price up.  If that upward movement has enough momentum, the gamma squeeze has a ton of upside potential. Now if you also happen to have a hedge fund with a massive short position in that stock, you also end up with a short squeeze as a result of the gamma squeeze.  = retards win if you have a real broker, you should be able to see stats like open interest (OI) and volume for individual options as well as options time and sales. if your broker doesnt, you can see stats in yahoo finance. if volume on a given contract us greater than OI, thats a sign people are expecting and betting on movement above that strike price. if you see large amounts of calls being bought up at a strike near the current price and date to expiration is short, that could be a sign to buy and play momentum on the way up. as more and more strikes become ITM, MMs have to buy in anticipation to cover their position and deliver shares if they are exercised, thus driving the price up and shorts buy up to cap losses, adding fuel to the price. Calls are your friend in this situation as retards buying and holding 5-10 shares at the top isn’t going to do anything. we haven’t see a true short squeeze, just two gamma squeezes with shorts covering on the way up. timing is everything. keep an eye on things that may seem unusual, but be rational. someone buying 1000 $800c is not really going to do anything, but large amounts of say $125c expiring this coming friday could be something. just be smart, dont chase, and know when to sell. its easy to say diamond hands when you bought at the top, but if you’re staring 1000% gains in the face, take profit If you held back then you lost so much it's not even funny. Bunch of calls finishing ITM =/ gamma squeeze. It partly has to do with option markers needing to buy ITM calls that expired Friday, T+2 to deliver. My assumption is by Wednesday they have to go into the market & buy. Hence the volume is sky high & lack of float it spikes 33 million shares shorted on Friday alone float originally was like 70 million not counting counterfeit shares so almost 50% of float shorted just Friday  Squeeze is far from squooze  short postions don’t need to close by any certain time just pay sometimes massive interest when it spiked but the hedges do need to buy shares to pay your calls going ITM and many of the writers sell them naked Depends on the theta and Vega. Unless it expires ITM and it’s above strike by more than the premium paid I think Bruce is right; I think the hedge funds that were short, scrambled to stop the bleed. They ran to Chicago market makers, bought deep ITM call options that expired on 2-26, at various price points, 40,45,50, etc. enough contracts to not only cover their shorts, but buy excess, sell for profit on the way back up. Stock hits 200, 250, 300, whatever, they profit off each sale. They could then turn around and short it again, and run to Chicago if needed to buy call options again. They still make their money. However, it’s now the Chicago marker makers that are on the hook for those naked call option shares.  I’m just a new, smooth brained ape, but it made total sense to me. Bruce and DFV have been right all along. This ape trusts 💎🤲 They have no options?? They literally have all the options. ITM calls laddered around their cost basis gets them to break-even, to a point where they shift the share buying pressure to the MMs that sold the options. These people are not as stupid as you hope they are. Or if it hits.... and he expires ITM they will have to buy those shares to cover and this guy would have helped catapult us into the clouds and ready to break atmosphere For my share's sake I hope you're waaaay ITM before expiration on these $31k on $420 calls in early March. Completely dumbfounding to me. I want GME to rocket, but I'm not betting $30+k on them heading to $420+ rapidly. If these options expire ITM, I'll eat a sandwich consisting of bread, mayo, and my hair.  Edit: It's OP's own money - if he wanted to buy, say, $800 calls expiring a day later, so be it/no judgement. Just not something I would personally do, even at $420 a week or so out So let me see if I understand this. Short squeeze is out. Panic buying from the call writers is in?  Edit: This reminds me of the weekend after the first run to $400. We all thought the calls that expired ITM on that Friday would have to be bought sometime Monday/Tuesday. The price was declining those days. So why is this time going to be different? It is better to buy ITM call options on GME at this point? The only thing I can think of that the options  market makers can do get out of their inconvenient position is increase the value of ITM contracts It's also foolishly assuming that market makers don't already have the shares FOR ITM CONTRACTS. Like, are you joking me? The only calls that might not be covered are deep OTM. And for those, they're probably buying from dark pools. Which, admittedly, I have no idea how they function and how buying from a dark pool affects the price. How does it sound implausible. Sounds like a reasonable play to do. Buying ITM calls and puts are certainly a way of buying/selling positions without having the underlying movement affect the transaction (leverage MM instead).  \> his logic assumes that the option writer will be willing to sell a call at the strike price of 60$ for a premium of ""just"" $65 even though the current market price is at $120  What are you saying, the premium numbers he gave are arbitrary but are still realistic. Whether or not the options are priced according to realized volatility is too complicated for us to decide. Not very knowledgeable in options but If I take the example of next week options, there is more volume on ITM calls than ITM puts, so I think that means there is an advantage for the bull side if you substract each side  High Put/Call ratio means nothing if all your puts are OTM  https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?straddle=true This is something I keep seeing people say as a point of concern, but I'm pretty sure it's not of huge relevance. My impression is that you don't have to exercise your call for it to impact the price positively (unless it's expired-- you can still exercise until noon on the Saturday after expiry). The reason is that the Market Maker / big money (usually) that sold you your call pretty much always delta hedges, meaning they buy to cover their call liability incrementally as the price comes ITM. This is what drives a gamma squeeze: as calls come ITM, those with call liability buy shares to hedge, adding to the upward price momentum. Once your call is deep ITM, your counterparty has hedged all of the shares already, so exercising doesn't add any market buys to the books.  If you exercise when it's just ATM, when delta hedgers have covered exactly half, you force half of your call's worth of market buys immediately. This is more explosive than letting them hedge on the way up as it comes deep ITM, but all the market buys go out either way. The explosive momentum is nice, but it's also risky since then your call won't be there to help lift off again if the squeeze doesn't take. In any event, if your goal is to add momentum to the price movement by adding market buys to the books, it's far more cost efficient to just buy the unhedged shares directly than to exercise the option. >that the Market Maker / big money (usually) that sold you your call pretty much always delta hedges, meaning they buy to cover their call liability incrementally as the price comes ITM. This is what drives a gamma squeeze: as calls come ITM, those with call liability buy shares to hedge, ad  Let me help!     If the options contract is IN THE MONEY then there is ALWAYS A BUYER! If you don't exercise it then you SELL it! To whom!? There is ALWAYS a buyer if is ITM. Usually the last buyers are COMPUTERS. They will buy your contracts for the smallest profit, exercise it and instantly sell it. They do that in microseconds. If the strike was $8 and the stock was $8.01 (like AMC) good enough! They exercise those instantly and re-sell them for $8.011. Remember you can early exercise too, so this happens a lot. Because that's how it always happens. They write many contracts and adjust their risk position as the stock changes.     BUT when it appreciates in ways that no one expected, so as the share price rises and becomes more likely that certain written calls are ITM, then these market makers will rush out to buy the stock so if they end up ITM they can cover. This is really why you can see the gamma squeeze.     In the case of GME it all comes back to the float. Because there are so few actual shares going around when it becomes time for them to go to market to get the shares they might have a lot of trouble locating any- driving the price up big time. This is the theory... Larger floats like AMC won't have a share shortage but you may still see a good old squeeze or a bit of a gamma BUT shorters don't have to cover unless they're margin called- and that doesn't really happen, they can just get more money or sell down long positions. So.... The only real squeeze is a long-term one, when the company actually is doing better and not likely to go bankrupt. TSLA great example. People shorted that for years. Most retails have no patience. How do you have more shares for ITM contracts than even exist? > It's also foolishly assuming that market makers don't already have the shares FOR ITM CONTRACTS.  You can look this up by looking how many calls there are out there, and how many shares there are out there. Apparently there's way more calls than shares. They didn't even need to buy ITM to do this. They would have bought contracts with strikes $60-$100+ when gamestop looked for all the world like it woud never touch $50 again. Then on Wednesday before the 2/26 expiration, they drive the price up to $150 and now their calls are ITM and the MM's can't get shares to fully hedge without squeezing even further.  This explains the volume on the $800c's btw- they fully expect those to be ITM next Friday. Call volume is not a useful indicator, it just means a lot of call OI is changing hands back and forth. Next week has put OI of 87,259 and call OI of 65,041.   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.   Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.   Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. Ok so basically, the key thing here is that the Hedgies can get their short position covered without driving up the price by buying ITM contracts and exercising them, and the MM have to go into the market and find the shares, which will in turn drive up the prices.  Genius. Call options ITM will always be executed before EOD. Someone will execute the option no matter what. That doesn’t mean the person executing holds the stock as they can execute and then sell the stock while pocketing the difference. Look at posts here from like 3 months back and you’ll see autists and retards buying 0dte options one hour before market close as crazy gambles in case the stock swings wildly in the last hour. I had to scroll WAY too far for this Jesus thank you. I don't know how people keep spreading this bullshit that an expired ITM would not be executed- they are all executed! Even if a retail trader doesn't sell, they don't get a choice- their broker is going to execute it. If they have the cash to cover, it's going to be used, and if they don't their broker is going to give the shares to them on margin. Option assignment only takes place after hours. That is absolutely not how it works. There's a reason why there are ITM options that are not exercised at expiry. Yes you are right! But last week, they also hoped for decreased price but it closed over 100 and the OI in ITM calls ended significantly higher than the OI in ITM puts  They always had plans for the GME price to decrease and that s why they lost this one and maybe the next one $18c, $20c and $25c for March 19, and $18c and $20c for January 2022.  Why? Because I have learned ITM calls, while more expensive, tend to go green more than OTM calls. >  ITM calls volume  what does this mean? It's a call contract, so if the price goes over $420 he'd be able to buy stock at below market price (in the money, ITM). The market value is going up because the position's likelyhood of being ITM is causing it's price to be $1600 more than when bought.  Options are also priced against IV (implied volatility) which by going up is driving the options value. Basically that $420 before April was really unlikely, but last week's volatility means it's more likely than initially priced in.  I'm just a retard who buys GME for shits and gigs, so disregard this. Some big brain will hopefully correct where I'm wrong. Mostly right - the gain right now is on _the contract's_ value, which has gone up due to models raising the ""chance"" (glossing over details there) of $420 or more being met before the expiration of the option contract (when it'd be guaranteed ITM/profitable to OP).  If OP wants to profit, they could have sold the option contract back at $1600, they could sell the contract before expiration at a higher value if it keeps going up, or can exercise the option before it expires and buy the number of shares in the contract at $420/share. Those can be held for a long position, or immediately sold for the difference (profit).  The value of the contract naturally limits towards the potential profit (since the buyer wouldn't pay more than nearly certain to make), or $0 (since the buyer considers 0 chance of ITM) as it nears the expiration date.  Pricing is controlled by models which incorporate several values, but IV (volatility) is the main driver from what I understand. It's regulated, so there's quite a bit of better reading out there on the details of options positions. Options are like hot potato. If my contract was statistically very unlikely to go ITM.... back when we were around $40... then GME rockets to $200 that Conract premium goes way up... and I can resell it to someone else at a higher price instead of holding to expiry.  Learn your greeks. Vega (Implied Volatility - IV) can make or break you. Idk if it’ll make it ITM but I’d like to think you have a good chance to make a profit Ey my fellow autistic degenerated fuckdolls.    * Wall street still view Gamestop as a brick and mortar company and bases their estimates on that. The neurodegenerative boomers are slowly waking up and this view is gradually changing. **When they finally understand that this is an e-commerce company the estimates and valuation *will* change.**  * Hedge funds and other **institutions *keeps* shorting**. Some are trapped and have no choice and others see it as a high risk high reward play. But we have hedge funds on our side as well. And they will help us reach escape velocity. The problem is not hedge funds, it's being able to short 140%.  * **Lots of options are ITM** and the total open interest is insanely high. It is rumored that CBOE is suspiciously quite about this.  * Since most of us are holding **the traded (real) shares is very low**. Some have mentioned 10m shares.  * No one thinks Gamestop will be the next Amazon. **But envision them having 1/10th of Amazon's market cap in a year or three.** That would put the share price at around 2000 dead presidents.  * **Ryan Cohen *is* taking over.** He built Chewy from nothing. He is in his fucking prime. This time he is not starting from zero.   * **ETF's *need* to buy more Gamestop** as the valuation grows to balance their funds.  * **There is *a lot* of money circulating at the moment.** The craziest bull market ever seen. This is perfect for Gamestop's situation.  *This is not financial advice. I enjoy painting with fecal matter.*  *Also, if you are tired of all the GME posts - sincerely, fuck you.*  💕🐱‍👤 ITM retard BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon.  HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK. After my last DD about how if we hit $800 today we would trigger the MOASS, there seems to be a lot of misinformation floating around illustrating this idea that if GameStop did *not* hit 800 today that it's over.  This is not the case in the slightest, and my only guess is a mix of shills/bots and worried newbies are spreading these comments.  *If it hits 800 any week it will trigger a massive gamma squeeze, but each week sooner it does it the greater the gamma squeeze will be. If it doesn't hit 800 today, it's not a big deal.*  What matters in gamma squeezes is the *number of contracts,* come next week there might be more contracts than this week anyway, there's literally nothing to worry about.  Hitting 800 in 2 days was very unlikely from the beginning, however, *if* it had happened it would have triggered the greatest gamma squeeze of all time, that's what made the 2/26 date so exciting. However, we still closed above $100, so that means that all the contracts from 40-100 this week are now ITM, which means we will most likely see a nice gamma squeeze next week. It's simply business as usual folks.  *If it hits 800* ***at any point***\*, we will still see a massive gamma squeeze as all the contracts will be in the money.\* There is no date restriction on this, 2/26 was just kinda insane because we had the potential to go from 40 to 800 in a span of 2 days, which would have been fucking bonkers.  That is all, just wanted to clarify some things cause I see a lot of worry for some reason. Yeah are you kidding those calls will be ITM. Not financial advice I like crayons **Speaking specifically to those call options...** There is always a chance. No one knows what will happen this week. That said you really need to have an exit strategy - not just for profit taking. A lot of things will be happening Monday morning at opening bell. What if pre-market is a banger and your options are deep ITM, but what’s this? A sell off at open? Whatever happens, you **must** know at what G/L% you will close your position.      Personally, with an option that close to expiration and with over 50% loss? I would have taken the L and sold to close on Friday. But what if it bounces and it makes a killing on Monday? What if it dives and you are wiped out? You don’t know. You can only speculate. And that’s the point of an exit strategy. People don't seem to fully appreciate HOW many options are VERY CLOSE to being in the money expiring today. As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will. Remember each 1 option = 100 shares.  Sort by VOLUME  $GME   [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme)   29,097 contracts @ $800   10,905 contracts @ $200   10,418 contracts @ $150  This is HUGE volume.

Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.  This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).  It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.  There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.  AMC has A LOT MORE: [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.  BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.  NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.  Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).  Everyone have a great weekend.  Disclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only. Do your own research. Not financial advice. Eat crayons.     EDIT 2: fucked formatting Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today.

Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight.

If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date! Hedge fund shills are spreading disinformation saying $800 is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.  It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.  DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN.  It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair.

At least that's what my autism tells me Hoping my PLTR May calls will print enough to recover from this week Idk how much longer I can keep buying the dip on PLTR lol PLTR $69 by 4/20 No longer drunk and PLTR still hasn’t mooned C PLTR $40 June 2022; C SNDL $2 1/2023; C KO 1/2023 $55; C WBA $60 1/2023; C PFE 1/2023 $40. Something’s gotta pay off. PLTR my mind is telling me nooo  But my body   But my body keeps telling me 🚀🚀 PLTR is the only stock that you can average down with everyday. PLTR has become an accidental yolo for me. I just keep buying the dip, but the dip kept dipping It's PLTR TSLA SQ ETSY FLGT ARKW BYND PLTR is going to the moon!!! PLTR wants to be added to FAPGANG I did not read this... but I like being in deep and getting my dick out so here’s my upvote...   TLDR: PLTR🔜🚀 I’m just an 🦍 so I’m still not sure that just printing $1400 per person is going to do anything good for the economy or the USD.  But screw it, if this makes it through the Senate I’m going to spend mine on $PLTR and a few shares of $GME for the cause. Before you buy any yolo option out there check the job numbers next friday and their implication on the Stonk market. Any good news Friday will absolutely decimate all the stonks retards love aka PLTR & co ...  PLTR go 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 I'm very bullish on PLTR. HF can short all they want, I believe this stock is amazing and will do well. Hate them all you want, they will be around for awhile. I'm going to have some tendies while it happens. Show PLTR some love you beautiful retards.. please 🙏🏼😂 PLTR gang I'm so loaded up on PLTR. Be nice to see them hit 40 if PLTR goes even for me @30, im definitely selling it for more GME Why PLTR? Am I missing something? Show some love to PLTR next week. Bro can we like save PLTR.   My fucking ass cant take this anymore I legitimately can't decide whether to buy more RKT to hold long or trade. This comment chain is like after 20 GME, 20 PLTR, and 15 AMC comments, you retards need to start looking past memes to see what legit buys (or other legit buys if you aren't ready to move past memes) are on the market right now. PLTR is doing bad because of over all market down turn + ending of employee lockdown period. People are off loading 10% of shares as they were waiting for 17 years to see liquidation event. Fact that they are all retaining 80%+ shares is a great sign. It should recover soon. Same, everytime I check PLTR in my portfolio am like ""Why can't you just be normal ?"" And face only autistic screams.  PLTR is pain those days I still like the GME stock but it seems to be an orchestrated dead cat bounce to get retail to FOMO in. Take a look at WSB and it clearly worked. It'll probably happen 2-3 more times in the future because people will bet the farm that GME goes up another 100-800% (and they would probably diamond hand for more because infinity gazillion is not a meme). Meanwhile, RKT is straight up free tendies with no downside risk. My prediction is that when RKT lands on the moon, the 7,000,000 new WSB members will FOMO in at the last minute (see Tilray, APHA, GME, AMC, NOK, BB, PLTR, etc...), and be stuck with the bag again. Then they will hate on whatever the next best play is before FOMOing into the top again. PLTR PLTR Is $PLTR still a Buy after insider stock sell off? PLTR has bottomed and reached oversold territory. It can only go up from here 🚀 PLTR is always a buy. To infinity and beyond this one. Triple digit bound 🚀🚀🚀🌕 Cathie Wood isn’t known for throwing good money into a fire pit. If she’s rolling large on it, who am I to second-guess her? I’ve got both PLTR and ARKK, so if both balloon, my wallet does. Serious question, but is the 1.6b shares outstanding and 1b float concerning? PLTR already has a 30b market cap, any significant price movement in the stock would take significant volume and a big market cap bump. Where they are priced now not only seems fair but also seems to have a few years of growth priced in. IBM and ORACLE have multiples higher of revenue and both trade about 3x stock price Bought $PLTR Shares beginning from the IPO date. Currently holding 3950 shares and placed some limit buy orders if it dips further. Meme stock?  Do people know the PLTR founder also cofounded PayPal ?  BUY PLTR I sold. Planning to invest in the company again, i believe they will do well.  My issue is the market instability and bubbles... I'm personally an idiot, and believe April might be a bubble burst.   Once I'm less afraid about everyone being bullish in every damn sector, I'm going in big on PLTR.  If you all get rich while I'm out, I'm cheering you on. Im in 56 @ $29.5ish and even though Ive might have jumped the ship a little too fast, I have full faith in their business.  They have been getting big goverment deals and they are moving more into retail as well. From my understanding they are also gonna help keeping an overview of who have been vaccinated for covid.  It has a high chance of going places and staying at those places because of their sticky model. They become rooted into the bunisesses they have contracts with.  &#x200B;  If GME goes to the moon there is a good chance some of that is being tossed into PLTR. I have a relative who works at PLTR.  You guys know it's a cover for Covert Cyber-ops, right?  Constantly doing work for the CIA, 5 Eyes, CSIS?  Not saying it's a bad investment - it's probably an awesome investment.  They will literally never run out of money.  But just know what you are buying.  Hang on... some dudes in suits with shades are knocking at the door... brb. if you like PLTR, you'll like SFTW. satellite company getting government contracts, backing by Thiel and Chamath, and deals with data like PLTR as well when cathie was getting deep into TSLA i didn't believe her.  when she went deep into PLTR i said F it and bought 1000 shares. picked up another 100 on Friday.  at about $50b the valuation is high, but who knows where this company will be by the end of this year, next year, 2 years. Thats not the one im worried about though. Its just a question of how long it takes things to bounce back up. Also holding PLTR 30 and FCEL 22  for April 16th. Those two making up 90+% of my current poofolio in pain.  If those go worthless, all my gains for the past year are gone. But then I get to post loss porn. :P same boat, I have 45 PLTR 30, 15 PLTR 29, and 50 PLTR 26.5 (bought recently on the dip) for 4/16 and my anoose is bleeding horribly from this week...here's hoping to an upswing from the tax returns and stimmy. Maybe you should buy some PLTR while you’re at it🦍🦍🦍💎👋💎💎💎👋🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀😕 I’ve sold off basically everything but the meme stock that I like. Waiting for a correction, then going balls deep back into YSG/TSLA/NIO/NIU and maybe RKT/PLTR later. I will tattoo WSB on my ass if PLTR hits $1000 by mid year. 2250 shares and will plow another $20k into it this week. How do people this fucking retarded have so much money for trading.  I'm also long PLTR but shit I don't even seeing it getting 200+ for at least 3 years lol. What a dumbass claim that obviously won't come true. I'll one-up you and tattoo the wsb guy's full body on my taint if PLTR hits Elon's favorite number by EOY. My asshole would make a great lens for his sunglasses. SEC dont deserve a hand shake. and PLTR is killing me The big spikes are my GME shares and one April 200c  Edit: other positions, bunch of ARKF calls that went to shit, 100 PLTR shares at 25 avg. calls on XOM and BP for July. couple other things in the red Shorts, lots of them, apart borrowing shares for shorts I don’t think it’s possible to go above 100%.   GME mutual fund ownership is 3192 %, AMC at 3000% ish, PLTR at 182%, BA at 1700% since everyone expect it to sink after the lost motor.  What is going on right now is absolutely crazy. I’m thinking about getting in RKT and a few others. Bruh do not buy GME with your inheritance check. Buy PLTR, it's at a great price right now. GME gonna burn ya. Invest in PLTR shares PLTR is for scrubs.  GME is for thugs. ARK bought over 3 million shares of PLTR between 2 etfs today Selling PLTR LEAPs Strategy    The Premiums on calls for PLTR@ 25 expiring 1/20/23, approximately two years from now are currently going for about $12. If you were to sell a covered call, based on the market close price of $23.90, you would have a cost basis of 11.90, and a premium of 12. But what if instead of just selling one CC, you sold 512, and then reinvested the majority of the premium back into more covered calls, and then repeated the process until you couldn't buy a full lot of shares anymore. I did the math on this, link down below, It would require approximately $ 1,223,680.00, to do so. Over the course of it you would come into possession of 102,300 shares, collect $1,227,600 in premium, spent about $400 in commissions, if it's at 0.40 a contract.  Your max gain would be $1,339,720.80, assuming it ends above $25, a return of %109 percent in just under 2 years, with a break-even price at approximately $11.09.  Now obviously selling so many options is going to affect the price, so you'll probably get a good bit less in premium then you would have, but what do you think guys, could this actually work?.  [https: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFw7yYPPTQzOiL4E69-08NUnA8mUhlXvQcCFa-cXvaE/edit?usp=sharing](https: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFw7yYPPTQzOiL4E69-08NUnA8mUhlXvQcCFa-cXvaE/edit?usp=sharing) If PLTR hypothetically took a big shit in this timeframe you could buy back the covered calls on the cheap cheap too and sell the equivalent amount of shares of the premium you didnt end up capturing entirely Ya unless Im missing something, your only risk in this trade that PLTR trades below your new net cost of $11.09 after the calls expire 1/2023.  Below $11.09 your down on your principal, but anything above $11.09 your profitable and the most likely scenario is you get your 100% gain, lose your shares and PLTR is much higher come 2023 TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.  # Premise:  Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https: www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.  But let me try to explain nonetheless.  1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https: www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields. 2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https: www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher. 3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something. 4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https: www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https: www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)    1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.    2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https: www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.       1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on. 5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think). 6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently. 7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.    1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https: www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income. 8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.  # Conclusion  Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:  This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.  Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade, I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.  ^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to retards on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)  Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.  * Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening. * We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon. * Black swan events. * Think of something yourself man! This was a long ass post and I am getting late for finishing my day's work. In **RKT DD Part I**, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. **Refer to RKT DD Part I Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)  In **RKT DD Part II** I discuss Rocket’s infectious culture from an employee’s (my own) perspective and why it will allow them to be the Amazon on Fintech. **Refer to RKT DD Part II Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt\_dd\_part\_ii\_a\_former\_employees\_take\_on\_rockets/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt_dd_part_ii_a_former_employees_take_on_rockets/)     **RKT DD PART III:**  Now I want to address you dumbasses who lump Rocket in with United Wholesale Mortgage Company and Loan Depot.  *LoOk HoW LoAn DePoT aNd UwMc ArE DoInG – MoRtGaGe CoMpAnIeS SuCk*  Listen you simpletons, Rocket Companies OWNS THE ENTIRE HOUSING ECOSYSTEM:  * From the Front end with their **Rocket Homes** business (Zillow, Redfin competitor) * To the origination of the loan via **Rocket Mortgage** (whether direct to consumer or through their broker channel) * To their **Amrock** title insurance business which orders the appraisals and title insurance * To their **Nexsys Solutions** with tools that allow for Remote Online Notarization, enabling the mortgage process to be 100% digital * And with their **servicing business** which allows them to think about their clients on a lifetime perspective rather than on just a transactional level.  As they continue to grow their entire housing ecosystem, they are also leveraging their tech platform for other ancillary businesses such as Rocket Loans and Rocket Auto.  Link to all of Rocket’s companies below:  [https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/](https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/)  **Let’s talk Rocket Auto:**  Investors mistakenly think that Rocket Auto hasn’t launched Yet. It’s true Rocket Auto hasn’t launched *publicly* but it doesn’t mean Rocket Auto hasn’t launched. **Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales, marketing and customer service.** Rocket even powers their e-commerce platform. They literally run every part of Vroom’s business except for the delivery of the vehicle.  If you look at VROOM’s 10Q, you’ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4-year agreement with VRM. The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8,641,914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four-year period, in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket’s e-commerce platform. That’s $430M worth of shares. Let’s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom (2015) so we don’t even know how much he already owns. See section of Vroom’s 10Q below:  *Paragraph in VRM 10Q: “On May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Rocket”) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the “Rocket Auto” brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the “RA Agreement”). The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform, but all sales of the Company’s inventory will be conducted through the Company’s platform.* ***Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2021*** *and, during the term of the RA Agreement, Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory. The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company’s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement.* ***The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period*** *based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.”*  As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter…and **what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday’s earnings report?** A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don’t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted.  I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom – why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn’t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it’s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly.  **Why is used car sales good for Rocket?**  Because Data, Data, Data.  Rocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans  Rocket can very easily have access to half of America’s homeowners credit reports by 2030 – The jackpot of consumer data.  What does a credit report tell you? **It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off.** This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform.  Look at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana’s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket’s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket’s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus – to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world’s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate.  Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes **1 million decisions per day** and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions.  Not to mention, ***Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales***\*\*.\*\* We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep – and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana’s presence.  **Rocket Homes:**  *WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW:*  Dear smooth brain, please download “Rocket Homes” on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow.  I’ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won’t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes.  I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket’s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial).  Not going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B – A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET’s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED.  **Rocket’s expansion internationally:**  Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B.  We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country.  Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket’s Lendesk fits the Bill.  Unfortunately these dumbass mods won’t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/) Link below:  [https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  This international expansion (along with Rocket’s other ancillary businesses) highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started.  **Short Squeeze**  Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares – but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares.  Despite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market.  To combat this unnecessary shorting, **Rocket announced a $1B buyback**; currently their float is $2B.  First off, who even announces a buyback when they’ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of.  Rocket’s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday’s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover?  Initially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn’t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn’t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August – that’s how much he believes in this company.  Gilbert has a big ego – so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron’s Fathead to Benedict Arnold’s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America’s biggest traitor*. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below:  [https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/](https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/)  This was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect.  Just like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I’m sure he’s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close).  Fun fact – even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James’ departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship… Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000](https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000)  **But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren’t they buying back shares at these these levels?**  Answer: because they likely can’t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain.  According to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading.  What is material information? Material information is any information that hasn’t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released.  What is Rocket's ""non-public material information"":  * The announcement of Rocket’s big, new financial partner * The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto  This information is likely to be made public on Thursday’s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float. And to put fuel on the fire, Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back, that is, if there are any shares left for purchase.  Gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs, imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into.  Say it with me now: Rocket Bears are Fucked.  TDLR: this doesn’t contain even a fraction of the information in this DD part three (or DD part one and two) but this dude does a good job summarizing RKT’s situation.

I’m buying call options on $RTX $RKT $BB $BA $TSLA $AMZN $BABA $JD $PYPL. Trillions are sitting on sidelines and are about to be put to work. I believe we are about to witness a huge bull run. Don’t even get me started on Home prices hitting higher highs. My hedge are $SPXU and $VXX calls as well. Gl on making the $3 mil back but I’m positive you’ll be back on top before eoy. When I get vaccinated I’ll be back playing baccarat as well. 🍻 Dumping it RIGHT into the $RKT squeeze! Worst case I collect the free 5% dividend payout, best case TENDIES ON THE MOON  Not a bot, not financial advice RKT actually makes $$$$ So what would drive that? Like I don't know if your investments are based on meme cycles that's pretty rough.  RKT bumped from killer earnings I legitimately can't decide whether to buy more RKT to hold long or trade. This comment chain is like after 20 GME, 20 PLTR, and 15 AMC comments, you retards need to start looking past memes to see what legit buys (or other legit buys if you aren't ready to move past memes) are on the market right now. RKT has the most asymmetric risk/reward. Floor is $20, and we can hit $50 due to the massive short interest, the special dividend, and the company buyback that are all intended to cause shorts to run for cover. 100% of all of these are shills. PS  RKT to $50 by 3/19 RKT IPOed last year, they're actually profitable and making a shit load of money. They killed earnings and gave a special dividen out (all this during a dam pandemin). Where you not around when RKT was like the top meme stock on this sub for like a good 2 weeks? RKT is a good companie, I sold my FDs last Fri for a good profit.  Possitions 900shares of GME on margin and selling weekly FDs to all you retards I still like the GME stock but it seems to be an orchestrated dead cat bounce to get retail to FOMO in. Take a look at WSB and it clearly worked. It'll probably happen 2-3 more times in the future because people will bet the farm that GME goes up another 100-800% (and they would probably diamond hand for more because infinity gazillion is not a meme). Meanwhile, RKT is straight up free tendies with no downside risk. My prediction is that when RKT lands on the moon, the 7,000,000 new WSB members will FOMO in at the last minute (see Tilray, APHA, GME, AMC, NOK, BB, PLTR, etc...), and be stuck with the bag again. Then they will hate on whatever the next best play is before FOMOing into the top again. ALL ABOARD THE RKT SHIP. 1 WAY TICKET YOU DIRTY FUCKING APES Shorts have been suppressing the price for months, genius move on the part of RKT management to smash them with the $1.10 divi.   New money will come in leading up to March 9th, finally breaking us out of this resistance at $24.  Shorts will also have to pay divi out of pocket (fuck em) AND a squeeze should be triggered as they scramble to cover. HOW HIGH WILL IT GO!? RKT to 💯🎯🚀 I got out of RKT not so long ago.. too much rollercoaster ride for me.. it should of been like $50 already Dear Autists,  This is your wife’s boyfriend speaking. RKT has an unreasonably low PE, has billions in cash, announced an insane dividend, killed earnings, has massive growth potential, is the 3rd most shorted stock on the market and the stock is owned 95% by RKT insiders meaning they will inevitably control the price in the short term future. The CEO will use the dividend and buy back program to annihilate the shorts and drive the price wayyy up, potentially to the 50s short term. This is NOT casino here, it is a legitimately undervalued company to invest in with little to no downside. This is a rare opportunity, please go balls deep in RKT on Monday apes.   Love y’all😍 Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰  Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:  When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.  RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself).   $RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back.   It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT.   BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?  GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you.   The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.  Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November.   Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.  BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:  Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?    TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌   Edit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40. To those who have family members who are special needs, I apologize - I am merely speaking the language of my targeted audience (WSB)  Positions: https: imgur.com/a/DbOCCYG (PTON is another story for another time) **NOTE:** I also have another 60k of RKT in my Roth.   ALSO THIS POST IS NOT A DD. To read my DDs on RKT click below (three DDs in one):  https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf I’m surprised more apes aren’t in on RKT simply because of its name. You fucking retards thinking GME is the only play in the stock market is becoming increasingly more frustrating.   I was hesitant on RKT, I even commented earlier this month describing my concerns regarding the potential negatives in the housing market. Sometimes it’s important to see things from both sides of the coin, and my bearish mentality was squashed after RKT’s recent earnings report.   There is no doubt to where RKT is heading. Here’s what I would suggest:  - roll your options from short term to leaps, even if that reduces your lotto positions. - keep adding shares under $25, it’s a no brainer. - stop worrying about informing retail on it’s benefits. They play such a small roll in it.   GME has stolen the show (I’ve got various positions in it), and there seriously is a weird mentality on WSB. It really won’t last forever and will cycle, just like mid-February.   Use this time to increase your RKT positions, especially while institutional investors increase their holdings (this is guaranteed).   RKT is a home run, potentially a grand slam. 10 baggers like this one don’t need viral assistance, in fact, it probably does it a disservice.   TLDR; I don’t just like this stock, I love this stock. Rocket $RKT gonna 🚀🚀🚀 it’s all in the name lads! DD makes perfect sense. I got spanked pretty hard buying GME out of the emotion of sticking it to the hedgies. This time I actually see long term sustainable value in RKT's coming squeeze. The squeeze id just icing on the rocket shaped cake for me. I bought my first ever calls before market close, I for sure think its set to pop in a big way.  What my fellow apes fail to recognize is for all the fun we're having losing money in GME, the company itself isn't doing a god damned thing to help the squeeze. RKT is actively setting the stage, offering a dividend incentive to do it, and planning to buy back float to increase the scarcity for shorts to buy back once they want out.   If you want to stick it to hedgies and don't give two shits about the long term of RKT, then at least collect $1.11 per share of literally free fucking money while shares are cheap then sell once you collect late March. I’ve been fucked by RKT before, fucked me good enough to go back for seconds I suppose, I’m in. Sitting on 500 shares of RKT now and 23k cash might yolo 1000 more shares. Dan G's shares are class D. the divvy is for class A only.   So shorts pay and RKT only spends 100 million  80% borrow fee 🚀🚀🚀  Small float  Billion $$$$ buy back  RKT 🚀🚀🚀 OP left out a buncha things. I think he ran out of crayons:   * The $1.11 special dividend is screwing  the shorts. If they own the stock til the dividend date, they have to pay the dividend to the folks they borrowed from. * RKT doesn't need the fucking money. They're profitable as fuck. They only did an IPO to allow insiders to have liquidity and/or acquire other companies. * Nearly all the time when a company is shorted, they expect it to lose money, or it's overpriced. Like I said, they don't need the money. However RKT did just have a huge 3rd quarter (and 2020) due to refinancings, so next year won't be as profitable. But they're still growing fast. * The lockup period for insiders to sell their stock came and went. No one sold, they know the stock is worth more.  * Main risk for a mortgage company is rising interest rates. The fed has said they'll [maintain the low rates until 2022](https: www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/fed-meeting-decision-interest-rates.html) * Because of the buyback program, the stock can't go down much. If it does, they'll BUY IT BACK. Stupid shorts, how are you going to make money if it the company will prevent it from going lower?  I personally think the special dividend was a FU to the shorts, and they'll start their buyback leading up to the dividend as a FU twice. So unlike GME we aren't relying on paper hands to squeeze the squoze. There's a billion dollars of squeezy-squeezy coming. We just don't know if it'll squeeze quick or slow.  Even if nothing happens, the likelihood of the stock going down is as small as your pecker in freezing ice cold water in the middle of winter. If you're going to try f'ing the big shorts, don't you want to practice safe sex?  I also like the stock. Will be holding long term anyway. They have really aggressive expansion plans which will pay off for years. 5k shares checking in  also they ***GUIDED Q1 UP 90%-99%!!!!***  RKT 🚀🚀🚀 \[̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅\] 🚀🚀🚀 Where the hell are you getting the ""RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares"" figure from? RKT mannnnnn I want to point out, RKT CEO has publicly came out and mentioned NOT to short the stock multiple times and issuing the dividend is telling shorts to F off. The company is about long term growth and getting shorts off their backs.   Unlike cough AMC who issues more shares to f shareholders.   RKT stands with its shareholders. Someone slap my monkey brain if I didn't get this right...but this is what I'm anticipating.  1. Special dividend. That's the first kick in the face for the shorts.  2. Special dividend at a crazy high price of $1.11 per share where the majority of shares are held by RKT insiders + retail investors like me + (here's the ""if"" part) if all of us being bullish on that and REINVESTING dividends = buying up more of the float. That's the first kick in the face  3. IF the CEO is really just loading up a big middle finger on the shorts, which it kind of looks like it, then he initiates the $1B buybacks at the same time the dividend pays out (March 23rd). A third kick in the face for the shorts.  Isn't that potentially the most brutal attack on shorts ever? So what is the play? I'm pondering an April 1st, 2021 call (after the dividend) for $21 and adding to my leaps that go out a year or two (not sure on the amount).  Are there any gaps in my understanding, idea, etc? Do those calls make sense for time and price?  Maybe I should just keep buying the stock instead. The short term options seem pretty attractive...lol RKT to 💯🎯🚀 I'm not seeing the connection here. Dividends go to shareholders. Even if they are insiders (i.e. employees of the company), that does not mean the money is going to the balance sheet of the company. The company can't use funds from its employees' bank accounts to fund a buyback.   I think RKT is interesting, but I'm not sure about this logic. Were you here when it IPOd? Replace GME of today with RKT of then and that's what this board looked like. WSB was RKT crazy when it IPOd. I have been in since shortly after IPO so nice to see it get some attention again. ..and that is RKT emoji to the moon or conversely...  get RKT? Days to Cover is just over 4+ now. The 02/25/21 update on SI through 02/12/21 push the number up to 43 mil shares.   The spike end of Jan was only about 6 mil shares cover and that pushed it from around $20-$23 before the shorts loaded back up. If you consider ~$.50/mil short, the squeeze would be $20+ and push this in to the $40's long term as the shorts unwind(and close to my price target of the upper $40's from my earlier DD on where it should be valued). Financials trade around 12x annual ER. The would be ~$48 if RKT was fairly valued. Unwind the shorts, and your there.  With strong retail next week, this could easily hit $50+ if shorts are forced to cover(interest payments go up the higher the stonk's price, the dividend adds more pressure to cover). You're fucking retarded, if someone follows what you said at the end of your comment they will literally make $0.  As soon as the $1.11 dividend is paid out, the stock price will drop by that much.   I'm big on RKT and planning for a long hold so don't get me wrong, I like the stock, but to buy shares to get the dividend and immediately sell in March is dumb as fuck. Stocks can be value and/or growth.  RKT is the ""and"". There is no catalyst per se.  They are growing organically eating market share and expanding into ancillary businesses.  The 95% closely held shares is a risk.  In fact, I believe that's why it's shorted.  But, RKT looks to be as interested in fucking the shorts as reddit so I don't see how the shorts win this 5% equals 115,000,000 shares in RKT CLASS A (public float) Common stock, 95% Dan Gilbert(owner) class D (not common or float) Also, isn’t this SD a tactic to pressure the shorts? Plus buybacks? RKT mgmt is doing the actual work from the inside. If more retail figures “this out, then 🚀, no? Dan Gilbert has spoken to this topic in his speeches. This sentiment is due to the fact that $RKT actually checks that people can pay their mortgages. It didn't fail in 2008 for a reason. It has stricter lending requirements ie: not retarded. This is also why people say they have higher rates, well, they don't. They just have higher rates for riskier people that deserve it. >financials trade around 12x annual ER.  what does annual ER mean? sorry im retarted - but RKT go up Abundantly clear that’s what the market has been doing to RKT since august 2020. Could they stop an intentional short squeeze though? Unless it goes up by more than $1.11. Which, granted, is a tall order for $RKT unless dynamics do actually change. All mine are set to expire 03/19 which bear in mind is after RKT counts who gets the dividends, but before the checks are sent.  I chose one in the money at strike $21.5, two out of the money at $24 and $30. I only did the high of $30 because I was short on funds and it only cost $38 lol. Perfectly understandable I wouldn't want to trade a buck for negative 5 bucks. However, looking at the financials of RKT I really think that the most conservative number it could call home given its PE compared to the mortgage market is $25 at the lowest. Thats still $3 higher than the price today.  That $1 payout is all a matter of how low you get in and how long you plan to play most definitely. I personally see it maintaining $30 until mortgage interest rates weigh on that whole industry for the next 1-2 years. After that I do see them capturing more market shares because the mortgage industry is still stuck in the glory days of the 90s-early 2000s it seems. I have some RKT shares . However the complicated 8% ownership structure stop.me from buying more. There’s a whole sub for RKT bag holders lol RKT is currently being valued as a boring bank stock. Jay has been preaching all the words of being a Fintech company. They are investing heavily into their platform in multiple different avenues to become the Amazon of their industry. RKT will be a triple digit stock, no doubt in my mind. Just look at current Fintech valuations and SP. This is a truly and undervalued gem that will eventually blast off and finally be adopted as a tech monster! I hope you all can see the value and pile on to ride out this future journey of fortune!!🤑😎👌 I am not following you. Shorting decreases a stocks price, so you're kind of defeating your own point. All I was saying above was that $RKT is down for the same reason the rest of the entire market is down, only it's down less. RKT 🚀 RKT to 💯🎯🚀 RKT is the meme stock that I can step away from for a week and see a 5 cent delta. It's about as boring as can be but man I love those earnings. Unfortunately I only have 200 shares. Shorts, lots of them, apart borrowing shares for shorts I don’t think it’s possible to go above 100%.   GME mutual fund ownership is 3192 %, AMC at 3000% ish, PLTR at 182%, BA at 1700% since everyone expect it to sink after the lost motor.  What is going on right now is absolutely crazy. I’m thinking about getting in RKT and a few others. The Post Earnings RKT Play - ROCKET TO THE MOON (Tendie Time) **TL;DR RKT is going to bull run all the way to the 9th March after its beautiful earnings and it's time to burn some shorts.**  Yesterday pre-earnings I posted some [DD](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsdpuz/rkt_to_the_moon_dd_and_short_squeeze_opportunity/) on why RKT (Rocket Companies) was a buy. I was right, the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10% from highs of a 20% gain during the day. To someone that has not followed RKT this may seem like a missed opportunity. WRONG. Welcome to the Amazon of the Finance World (well near enough).  Rocket by all traditional measures should've risen to $25 (previous close of $19.90) minimum today. Their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past. Practically since the IPO institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls, some covered, some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between $19 and $21 or to average down from a bag holding position above. These players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase (a potential gamma squeeze if it did so). Hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below $22.  **Next week, things start to change...**  But before that let's just go over the insane earnings they just report:  1. **EPS $1.09** (analyst prediction $0.87) an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from $754 million to $2.84 billion. 2. A **special dividend of $1.11** per share to Class A common stock holders on March 9th (note this is important autists). 3. **Partnerships with a multitude of companies including JP Morgan**. 4. Stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended. 5. There's more little nuggets but that's enough for ape brain to take in.  **So what happens next week?**  Firstly the dividend at current stock price is just over **5% yield**. An insane amount. This provides a catalyst for the price in two ways. Firstly, who doesn't want any easy 5% return? This is hardly priced in let's be realistic. These earnings give RKT as **PE of 5**. Way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around **3 to 4 times too small** if you consider them a Fintech.  More importantly, let's have a look at RKT's **short interest**. It lies somewhere between 35% and 40%. Now let's be clear this isn't going to be a Reddit, retail investor driven **short squeeze**, RKT has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million BUT if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure. Shorts have to pay the dividend - an instant 5% loss is not a good look and who knows if there'll be more to come in later earnings. With call holders less in the equation, the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies. It's time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the IPO.  Everyone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover, and 40% of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me. A huge difference between RKT and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above $30 indefinitely (or higher). Shorts don't like to be stuck indefinitely losing, unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse - not that they will unless you all have weak hands. Expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around $30+ to drive the price up more.  With all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of March. I have a genuine PT after that earnings of $40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ship's favour the moon is only the beginning. This Rocket is going up Uranus like your wife's boyfriend's is up hers.  Rocket is recruiting diamond hands, I am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10% profit BUT autists and apes we can get 100%, 200% or more!  RKT closed at $21.85 today. It is my firm believe RKT is a **brilliant buy** after these earnings under $24 and if the bull run starts all the way to $30. Management want these shorts out and that's good enough for me, the CEO laughed at the shorts on CNBC.  I am willing to put my money where my mouth is as I averaged up from $30 per cent equivalent CfD contracts at $20.30 to $41 per cent equivalent at $20.91.  In other words get us to $46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade. These values are actually GBP but I presumed you only know dollar due to autism.  **I just like the stock. So buy shares, squeeze shorts.**  **RKT TO THE MOON!**  [Earnings Call Transcript](https: www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/)  EDIT: VERY IMPORTANT POINT - some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95% is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion not far off GME.

But heads up, JP Morgan recently dumped 92% of their shares.    [RKT Institutional Ownership - Rocket Companies Inc Stock (fintel.io)](https: fintel.io/so/us/rkt) RKT actual SI% is near 70%. Cost to borrow is over 30 and DTC is at 7.8. Shorts got in looking for bad earnings and now they are holding their breath on a stock that analysts have now reversed their ratings on. Do your own DD but high SI along with special dividend and power earnings spells at least a $24-$33 price already built in in next two weeks. Oh fuck...u apes leave RKT alone...this shit is gonna tank now...fml RKT is my largest holdings. 20,000 shares long and strong holding for years or $200/share what ever comes first. Love the RKT!!! Funny thing though, 2008 was good for RKT, while other mortgage originators were dying off, RKT (Then Quicken Loans) was expanding.  They didn't go for the quick buck and scam people with the sub-prime mortgages.  They looked to the future and that's how they eventually became #1.  The next downturn in the housing market will just see a much larger RKT gobble up a much larger chunk of market share. Who else is ready for the RKT ride? RKT to 💯🎯🚀 RKT Yolo update - end of month. 75% shorted. Dividend lock in on March 9. Fuel loaded 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 shorts better cover or they’ll be paying extra to their lenders Courtesy of u/brawnerboy  I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https: www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)  If you haven't already, you should read it.  Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.

As they continue to grow their entire housing ecosystem, they are also leveraging their tech platform for other ancillary businesses such as Rocket Loans and Rocket Auto.  Link to all of Rocket’s companies below:  [https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/](https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/)  **Let’s talk Rocket Auto:**  Investors mistakenly think that Rocket Auto hasn’t launched Yet. It’s true Rocket Auto hasn’t launched *publicly* but it doesn’t mean Rocket Auto hasn’t launched. **Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales, marketing and customer service.** Rocket even powers their e-commerce platform. They literally run every part of Vroom’s business except for the delivery of the vehicle.  If you look at VROOM’s 10Q, you’ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4-year agreement with VRM. The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8,641,914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four-year period, in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket’s e-commerce platform. That’s $430M worth of shares. Let’s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom (2015) so we don’t even know how much he already owns. See section of Vroom’s 10Q below:  *Paragraph in VRM 10Q: “On May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Rocket”) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the “Rocket Auto” brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the “RA Agreement”). The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform, but all sales of the Company’s inventory will be conducted through the Company’s platform.* ***Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2021*** *and, during the term of the RA Agreement, Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory. The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company’s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement.* ***The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period*** *based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.”*  As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter…and **what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday’s earnings report?** A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don’t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted.  I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom – why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn’t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it’s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly.  **Why is used car sales good for Rocket?**  Because Data, Data, Data.  Rocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans  Rocket can very easily have access to half of America’s homeowners credit reports by 2030 – The jackpot of consumer data.  What does a credit report tell you? **It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off.** This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform.  Look at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana’s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket’s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket’s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus – to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world’s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate.  Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes **1 million decisions per day** and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions.  Not to mention, ***Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales***\*\*.\*\* We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep – and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana’s presence.  **Rocket Homes:**  *WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW:*  Dear smooth brain, please download “Rocket Homes” on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow.  I’ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won’t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes.  I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket’s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial).  Not going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B – A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET’s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED.  **Rocket’s expansion internationally:**  Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B.  We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country.  Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket’s Lendesk fits the Bill.  Unfortunately these dumbass mods won’t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/) Link below:  [https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  This international expansion (along with Rocket’s other ancillary businesses) highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started.  **Short Squeeze**  Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares – but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares.  Despite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market.  To combat this unnecessary shorting, **Rocket announced a $1B buyback**; currently their float is $2B.  First off, who even announces a buyback when they’ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of.  Rocket’s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday’s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover?  Initially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn’t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn’t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August – that’s how much he believes in this company.  Gilbert has a big ego – so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron’s Fathead to Benedict Arnold’s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America’s biggest traitor*. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below:  [https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/](https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/)  This was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect.  Just like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I’m sure he’s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close).  Fun fact – even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James’ departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship… Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000](https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000)  **But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren’t they buying back shares at these these levels?**  Answer: because they likely can’t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain.  According to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading.  What is material information? Material information is any information that hasn’t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released.  What is Rocket's ""non-public material information"":  * The announcement of Rocket’s big, new financial partner * The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto  This information is likely to be made public on Thursday’s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float. And to put fuel on the fire, Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back, that is, if there are any shares left for purchase.  Gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs, imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into.  Say it with me now: Rocket Bears are Fucked.  TDLR: this doesn’t contain even a fraction of the information in this DD part three (or DD part one and two) but this dude does a good job summarizing RKT’s situation.

YOLO,61,147910," My friend says I'm financially irresponsible because I YOLOed 40% of my net worth on 1dte SPY puts, even though I made 30% on it  Told him to fuck off til I lose I legit YOLO'd 90% of my savings into 1 penny stock. I know that feel. YOLO you fackin tards You should change the slips of papers to buttons that when pressed actually YOLO your entire savings in GME or some other stock of choice. So what you're saying is to YOLO in when it hits $400 and post the loss porn for upvotes? Deal. I just like the stock!  Yes, anyone spending more than there YOLO fund (e.g. money you're happy to loss for the glory of the meme) you're a fool. Note, my wife's boyfriend said to remind you all that I'm an ape retard, or retard ape depending on your choice and this is not financial advice But did CashApp know about the 2021 stimulus in Feb 2020??   Really?  DFV bought 1000 April 2021 calls sometime during the month of Feb of 2020 as best I can tell - before anyone knew the extent of COVID.  So he likely had no clue about stimulus when he placed that bet.  That's all I'm saying.  It looks like a good bet (for him, not suggesting anyone else should take that bet now) but my conclusion based on the data is that it had NOTHING to do with the stimulus.  Go look at his YOLO post history and confirm for yourself.  Good luck, friend.  Hope your strategy plays out for you. Lmao imagine 65 year old boomers selling $2.5MM of VTSAX to YOLO GME I'm going to assume OP is a millionaire who is having some fun buying some YOLO calls Everyone in here is talking shit about OP without realizing that GME could, in reality, hit $800 this week. This stock is volatile as hell. There are many big players in the game, from whales to institutions. Is this a YOLO? Yes. Is it regarded? Undoubtedly. Could it actually pay off? Yes, it could.  Also maybe 25k is fun money for OP, who knows. This sub is full of rich people. I got you fam. 400 contracts for 3/19 at $800 strike... $160K YOLO!! Damn GL bro. I know I'm buying GME on Monday. Can't risk it now that this guy is YOLOing. Though I would have bought some NIO calls then parlayed that into GME/AMC. This isn’t investing or interesting.  The guy on the other side of your YOLO is YLED...deep out of the money bets are retarded. Wait payout of 1.7mm how? Like if it hits 800?? Are you fucking serious??  Edit: I was asking if you were serious because of how fucking stupid the claim of 1.7mm potential profit is. You won't even get your money back. You'll start Monday down even more because of Theta decay. You're a fucking idiot and you deserve to lose money. This isn't even a good or entertaining YOLO, there are so many better ones. Fuuuck these GME fucks are gonna give me an aneurysm. It’s not a YOLO of you can afford it You mean like how everyone YOLO'd and expected it to hit $800 last friday? And the friday before that? And the friday before that? Look at the posts from WSB a couple years ago. It's the absolute degenerative bets that laid the foundation of this sub. This is a nice nostalgic throwback to the ACTUAL YOLOS people would make. Not some loser that holds 10 share in a memestock. This is a place for BETS DFV didn’t buy deep OTM call options expiring a week from purchase. This is closer to an old school WSB, minus the earnings, FD YOLO play. Anyone find a WSB yummy meme circa ~2016-17 of the boy from Sixth Sense revealing to his mom in the car that he's YOLOing a bunch of options after bullshitting his way through Robinhood verifications/restrictions?  I gave it a little hunt and didn't secure the goods.  Edit: Looks like haupt91 made an updated version a month ago for GME. I remember that posting. Requirements were 3+ years of Reddit (especially WSB) and history of YOLOing tens of thousands on deep OTM options.  Honestly, sounds like a wet dream.  EDIT: oh, another requirement was to not be brainwashed by mainstream ideas about the market (like it being rational). Fuck this beautiful shit I YOLO'd at exactly 154   &#x200B;  ....for the second time hahaha Hahahahaha! When the lizard takes off at YOLO at 154!!!! Well done you horizontally walking genius. Got kicked out of bed at 4 a.m. because I was laughing so hard I shook the bed with the YOLO @ 154. I hold that bag with pride. But god dammit I can relate to that lizard. YOLO @120!? I YOLO @250! YOLO at $154 killed me ""YOLO @ 154!"" Was my favorite part. I started giggling in my kitchen. But only after he YOLOs 😂 Been seeing a lot of comments in the past few days, “What’re the chances this is actually going to work?”-esq questions. Look, I’m not going to make you wrong for asking these types of questions because they are rational questions - but WSB wasn’t founded on rationality - it was founded on YOLOing our children’s college funds away and making memes about it. This is a MOONSHOT; not a sure bet - if you can’t handle the fire get out of the kitchen (aka sub to r/investing and get a nice safe index fund).  Here are the facts -> They NEED our shares. We are seeing them BLATANTLY use every trick in the book (naked shorts, keeping prices artificially low, blocking trading, etc) - in fact, they’re not even pretending or hiding it anymore. It’s out in the public - anyone who cares to see it can see it. But here’s the thing: despite all their tricks, at the end of the day - they still NEED our shares. At this point, it is a battle of attrition; they can only keep up their charade for so long before they literally have nothing left to short and they have to buy back their shorted positions (side note: I’m a retard and this prob isn’t exactly how it works but close enough so just fucking go with it for now). By holding (think Articuno chilling in cave [Seafoam Island] status) we lose NOTHING. If people keep buying/selling back and forth, it is playing into their hand. They want us to get bored and sell - behind all their dirty tricks, it sums up to them just trying to get us to sell - either through fear or boredom. Do what you got to do - but I am holding until the bitter fucking end.  Tldr; don’t get fatigue/boredom/fear from this - that’s what they want. Take time away and come back fresh. And most importantly - HOLD  Edit: Include specific location of Articuno’s YOLO spot  Edit 2: change “short ladder attack” to “keep prices artificially low” herp derp So I read WSB MOONDHOT NEED BLATANTLY NEED NOTHING HOLD YOLO  what did you guys see Just in time for YOLO on GME calls Well ya see, back in aught eight I had $30k to yolo on stonks that were on sale, of course back then a stonk was called a Honey Badger and you could get seven honey badgers for thirteen cents. that's why it was called a quarter fourteen, cause you could get fourteen badgers for a quarter.  Anyway, I wanted to YOLO that money on $F when it was around nintey seven cents, but momma Pound she said to me, ""Ezra, if you Yolo your inheritance into a single Honey Badger you're a damn fool!"" so I didn't and wound up taking all that money and building a race car daily driver.  And that's the story of how I spent a lot of money on a car that became a rusty pile while $F soared to $11 per share today! This is a classic wsb YOLO. Liquidate all other investments to go all in.   This type of behaviour should be encouraged.    Betelgeuse or bust baby. Honestly was about to YOLO when it was at $85 but since we still have time before the squeeze it might hit $50 again. If it doesn’t and goes to $200 tomorrow I’m happy with my 44 shares @ 166. YOLO your swag on gme put options that expire Friday and have a heart attack when you lose it all  when they give you that morphine bag after open heart surg you can grab it and just squeeze on it to get some faster drips to come out and then you get liiiiit  IV crush is so liiiiit broooo Nope! It’s the perfect time for a YOLO. You should go full retard on this one. Ahh shit... YOLO 😂 Probably YOLO’d SNDL at the top and can’t get in on the action CRSR 100k YOLO.. I like the stock.. :$ 🚀 Hard to buy more on the YOLO investment strategy as have to wait for next payday I have no clue what the fuck you are talking about.  JUST TELL ME WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD YOLO MY NEXT PAYCHECK. The old guy crying and the young boys winning against the system is exactly why this 50 year old single mom jumped in to help.  Holding the line until GameStop succeeds and cant wait to tell my future gamer grandchildren all about how it came to be.   Thanks to all of you wonderful apes for YOLO’ing the greatest story on earth right now and for giving me something to proudly be a part of — diamond hands forever!

That's about to change drastically. This morning, Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42.3%, said they repurchased $24.7 billion in shares in 2020, and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year ([2](https: www.berkshirehathaway.com/2020ar/linksannual20.html)). In addition, Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter. However, more important than any of these things (as significant as they are) is what was missing from the letter this year.  As many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years. He's complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term. In the meantime, he's fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines, banks, japanese conglomerates, etc. With this backdrop, remember that Buffett is not a boomer, he's from the Silent Generation. So, what he didn't say in the report is really important.   So what the fuck didn't he say? He didn't complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn't warn that BRK might lag SPY. You're not grasping the significance yet. Let me explain.  The reason he's been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants. In fact, he explains in his letter linked above that they're even better. He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them. Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner.  Over the next year, the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter. There's no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine.  Also, here's some simple math for you. SP500 P/E ratio: 38.8. BRK P/E ratio: 13.5. [Yes, I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK's P/E. That's because BRK's portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income.] This means BRK's underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion!  This is why Buffett didn't warn that BRK might underperform. He's back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY's ass again. Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK's multiple again.  Calls were cheap on Friday so I bought 170 BRK.B $242.50C 3/5/21. $50K YOLO on the Oracle of Omaha. YOLO into GME calls next week? GME YOLO month-end update — Feb 2021 I’m new to Reddit and this GME thing and I’m coming in on the end but I’ll throw 1K at it. YOLO right? That's because I YOLO'd the moving expenses into GME. Sorry? Weekly Market Forecast - 2021-02-27 YOLO Capital Hello Apes,   This is one of my first posts and am going to try to make this a weekly thing to help you apes and autists out.   Hedgefunds and asset management firms have these analysts preparing all these market forecasts all the time. I feel like us apes could come together to defeat the hedgies by putting all our thoughts together and getting a sense of how the market might look like in the near future. So we can get tendies! Who wants tendies? I want tendies!  Please note this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I am just an ape. This is purely for education purpose. Please consult a financial advisor not me.  You all must be wondering, what the hell is going on in the market lately? Why are stonks down? Where are my tendies?  Well Apes, apparently there are these things called bonds. JPOW sells these things at auctions and people buy them! Can you believe it? People actually buy things other than stonks.  Lately these bond traders have been very worried that things are getting back to normal! There's $1.9 trillion on its way and that means tendies! Tendies for everyone! And that means prices of things might go up. And if that happens then Fed might have to raise interest rates to keep the prices from getting out of control!  These genuis bond traders have ultra paper hands and they were expecting rates to rise in 2023. But they are afriad they might go up in 2022! Oh lawd! Have mercy.  If interest rates go up. It means stonks go down! Witchcraft! These bond traders are scared and pooping their pants. No one is buying, which is driving the prices of some of these bonds down. means yields are rising! Rising yields oh no!  Everyone is panicking and cashing out.  So bond traders are all looking at JPOW like what you gonna do. You gonna keep running that printer or stop? JPOW is like. Whatever YOLO. But bond traders are not convinced. They feel like JPOW like a cheating boyfriend is lying and will probably backstab them and raise rates.  So bond traders don't wknow what to do. They are panicking. Scared and running around like chickens without heads. All this fear is spreading into the stock market and people are selling their stocks.  Stocks are down! Stocks are down! Stocks are down!  So what's ahead? Well Feb's job report is out on FRIDAY. If the numbers look good Thats Bad! Good means bad because it means things are getting back to normal. No! Bond traders don't want things to get back to normal. If numbers are bad Thats good! Because that means less risk of higher rates.  Good is bad and bad is Good!  What in the world is going on?!?  Well - All you need to know is JPOW is speaking on Thursday. Everyone will be watching. If he says something stupid... Stonks will go down. So lets hope he doesn't say anything stupid. Job reports out on Friday. If report is good then more red!   Also - Expect some more red if bond traders panic a bit more and drag the stocks down. If there is fear in the market then fewer insitutions will buy stuff. Apes are still buying. So keep buying and keep holding those diamond hands. Don't paper hand! Hold Strong! Let the insitution paper hand. If we keep holding. The market will stabilize in the next week or so. If we buy that means more tendies.  All the best Apes. Just remember, expect turbulence ahead. But it will pass in a week or so. As soon as those stimulus cheques hit the streets, there will be tendies! Glorious tendies.  Apes:   What is Queen Cathie doing:    Investors took out $1 billion out of her funds last week. People are pancking. Queen Cathie is staying calm and Diamond Handing (Bought): Palantir, Twitter, Square, Paypal, Signify Health, Baidu, JD, Tesla, Spotify.

Let's see who wins in the next couple of weeks. If you thougth last week was volatile. Just wait till you see whats in store for the next couple of weeks!  Apes Strong -  If you disagree or have any questions, feel free to msg me or leave a comment. Thanks! 💎🙌🦍here. I wrote some basic advice I'll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action, or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper-handing. Paper-handing is fundamentally bad investment practice, especially if you're a new investor. I'll explain why.  *DISLAIMER: I've only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff, and he hasn’t steered me wrong yet. So take it for what it’s worth... But based on all the fact that paper-handing is even an issue here, you apes clearly need this advice.* ***EDIT: These are ""fundamentals"" to the way I trade, but obviously everyone's trading strategy is different. Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing, which doesn't encourage YOLO-ing. This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to ""outsmart"" the general public by spotting opportunities/value before the market does. I feel it's particularly relevant to the GME play. The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it. There are other approaches (which often require more experience) but I feel this is most accessible to new investors. GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything. Well, everything that you don’t think will go bankrupt or get delisted.***  **New traders, or people who are thinking of becoming new traders, should read this.** Especially if you're new, I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market. This applies to all stock, not just GME. If you're experienced, it might just sound like I'm explaining at length why 2 + 2 = 4, but since a friend of a friend told me he paper-handed on GME (sold the dip), I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea.  **I would encourage people to buy GME, but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while.** (edit: in addition, just to reiterate, keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down) By this I mean **NEVER SELL AT A LOSS**. Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down. All newbie investors (IMO) should adhere to this rule just in general. Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground, or don’t buy it at all.  Many investors, myself included, follow this rule religiously, not just with GME but with all stocks. I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss, I just held or bought more. COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out? I just held and was fine... should have bought more. If everyone bought into GME with this mindset, I bet it would go to Pluto easily.  If you sell at a loss, you are donating to the ""save the short sellers"" fund out of your own wallet, fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes, and you’re not even following sound investment practice. Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy. If you’re thinking of investing so much that you’ll wuss out, poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red... just don’t. Emotion and the stock market do not mix well.  Stop losses (below purchase price) are also for pansies and genuine idiots. “I’ll sell you some stock... but only if you give me a bad enough price on it.” Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down... if you feel like you need a stop loss, you're investing more than you should. Instead of being stupid, maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips.  Side note: personally, in the case of GME, I don’t have any limit sells either. From what I can tell on past short squeezes, the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down. So as long as you keep an eye on GME when it actually does skyrocket, you should have plenty of time. Set price alerts and relax. No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid-launch.  Although, if you want you can try to profit off GME volatility. Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I'm not sure they deserve it. As far as I know, buying low and selling high doesn’t really help HFs, it drives the price up (just not as much as buying and holding). But personally, my philosophy is, I can take baby profits anytime... who knows when something like this GME rise will happen again. So I’m holding (101 shares at cost average $106/share).  Want to get into the game now? You could always just buy a few shares, and keep the rest of what you’re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip. And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more, bringing your cost average down. Ideally, you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero. Always try to keep cash in reserve.  Locked yourself in at a high price? That's why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down. Didn't keep any cash in reserve? Guess you're stuck waiting for one of three things: 1) the short squeeze which will likely (though not certainly) happen, 2) for the price of GME to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases, or 3) you get your hands on some more cash you're willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down. **DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS** and you will never lose (edit: well, seldom, if ever. Unless the company goes bankrupt, a rare occurrence. This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket, and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero, it won't swallow your portfolio. Also, if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something, you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson). Hedge funds and billionaires know this, that's why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic. They bought the dip while regular folks paper-handed and got even poorer.  One more little trick. If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares, then even if your position goes “underwater,” you can always sell calls at above your average cost, bring DOWN your cost basis, and make money off your stock “risk free” while still following the rule of never sell at a loss. Although if you did it right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze. Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen, and you'll need to be patient and, like I said before, say goodbye to your money for a while.  **EDIT:** Just to reiterate, there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies. Trade however you want, just don’t paper hand GME. I would also note that you *can* sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule, if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price. It still follows the rule of ""don't sell at a loss."" Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100, doesn't matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier. You can even (slowly) take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5%, and sell one when it goes up 5%.  **EDIT:** Yes I know about opportunity cost. It does apply if you know something the general public doesn’t (rare if you’re just a low IQ ape but GME was/is an exception). Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn't, it could be a coin flip whether you'll hit rock bottom. In an ideal world, you can keep some money in reserve so you don’t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities. Yes I know about (and agree with) the sunk cost fallacy. My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal, lowering the cost basis, not “doubling down” on sunk cost.  Tl;dr 🦍buy 🍌, don’t give 🐍 🍌 unless 🐍 give more than 🦍pay for 🍌  Not financial advice. I am literally a zoo ape that somebody dropped their phone into the enclosure of. I've been seeing a lot of Uranium bull cases on WSB, r/investing, and r/stocks. A main point that keeps getting repeated is Biden = clean energy; nuclear = green energy. Unfortunately, I don't don't it's quite that simple.   Here are some points you may want to consider before YOLOing all your money. I'm not taking either a bull or bear position, but wanted to lend insight about the industry with my family of Reddit degenerates so we can help each other make money.   Nuclear power is a very productive source of energy globally and, unlike with fossil fuel combustion, its use does not increase greenhouse gas emissions or contribute to acid rain. It is safer to mine than coal, but reactor meltdown and contamination from breached nuclear plants are significantly more hazardous (e.g. Chernobyl, Fukushima Daiichi). In addition, the problem of high-level radioactive waste management has confounded us for decades, and government efforts to address the negative production externalities of nuclear power are a demonstration of spectacular bureaucratic failure.    Radioactive waste cannot be treated to make it nonradioactive, and thus storage is the only option. To my understanding, all radioactive waste produced by commercial power plants in the United States are currently in temporary storage, many of which are near capacity. We do have the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant ([WIPP](https: en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant)) in New Mexico for transuranic waste produced by our government during the creation of nuclear weapons; more than 3.7 million cubic feet of transuranic waste has been received by that facility (about half of its 6.2 million cubic feet capacity), but the site remains dedicated to defense-related radioactive waste containment. Further contributing to our nuclear waste management problem is fact that we do not reprocess our spent commercial reactor fuel elements (unlike France, China, Russia, Japan, and India), and thus create more waste than necessary.    Improper waste storage is both a safety hazard and extremely costly to clean up as evident by the Hanford, Washington radioactive [waste leakage](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site). An estimated one million gallons of liquid waste escaped from containers in Hanford, with some entering into the Columbia River. The Department of Energy (DOE) spends about $2-3 billion per year on cleanup efforts at the site, but bioremediation, chemical stabilization, storage transfer, and soil decontamination are expected to take many decades and cost over $110 billion.    The [Nuclear Waste Policy Act](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Waste_Policy_Act) of 1982 intended to establish two commercial waste disposal sites - one in the west and one in the east of the United States (to be determined by DOE) - and formed the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, which instituted the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF), supported largely by spent-fuel fees on waste generators and a 0.1 cent per kw-hour surcharge on nuclear powered electricity. To date, over $44 billion was paid into NWF ($750 million annual revenue) to finance disposal site identification costs and over $10 billion has been spent on this effort.    In 1986, after years of research (considering factors of climate, population density, low regional water table, seismicity, et al.), DOE proposed three potential western area locations for permanent nuclear waste storage: Hanford, WA; Yucca Mountain, NV; and Deaf Smith County, TX. Unsurprisingly, all three states (and Tennessee) protested the nominations. In late 1987, Congress finalized [Yucca Mountain](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository) as the selection. Yucca Mountain was already on federally owned land and partially overlaps the Nevada Test Site (used previously for nuclear weapons testing) in Nye County. Despite millions from the NWF in compensation packages offered to the state for hosting high-level waste disposal, the designation and effort still faces bipartisan opposition.       Yucca Mountain site characterization began in 1986, with the original projection estimating initial construction in 1998 and waste disposal beginning 2003. In reality, the site analysis and DOE’s environmental impact statement wasn’t completed/issued until 2002. DOE filed a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2008 to begin site development, with officials hoping for project completion in 2017. Twenty-seven years later, after many lawsuits, continued opposition from Nevada and environmental groups, and roughly $10 billion spent from when Nuclear Waste Policy Act first began formal efforts to create a permanent disposal system for nuclear waste, the Yucca Mountain project **was ultimately suspended under the Obama administration**. Increased regulatory expectation issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2008 further complicated progress toward disposal site design and execution. Back in 1985, the EPA specified that high-level waste was to be confined in a manner that results in fewer than 1,000 fatalities over 10,000 years, which is the predicted rate with unmined uranium ore; the timetable for isolation is now extended to 1 million years.     With global climate change and pressure to produce more CO2-neutral energy, nuclear power remains an important contributor of global power production (especially for countries with limited access to their own supplies of fossil fuels). Unfortunately, the lingering radioactive byproducts and safety hazards from compromised reactors are externalities for everyone outside of the industry, including those who live in areas not serviced by nuclear power.    I guess, to be fair, no other nation has a permanent storage facility solution established for their nuclear waste either, so it appears that we are all stuck in this radioactive waste management dilemma together… except maybe Finland. The [Onkalo](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository) spent nuclear fuel repository is under construction and anticipated to be operational in 2023 (barring additional setback). The risk of radioactive waste discharge and contamination from impaired permanent containment facilities are also externalities for current and near-future human civilization and whatever mutant race/creatures outlive us. (Hopefully they understand our primitive radioactive warning symbols.)   TL;DR - Nuclear power is a great clean energy source but its growth and adoption is constrained by waste storage.   Good luck to everyone with your investments. I hope we're all rolling in green portfolios and unrealized/realized gains again soon.   Positions: None in nuclear energy (mines, tech, etc) VIAC: A Short Story YOLO Update # 🐸 is getting ready to leap.  This is my first DD post so I would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions I am making here. But I thing that JFrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why.  # What do they do?  Their main product is JFrog Artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries (runnable code) and it also serves as a mirror repository - local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer JFrog X-Ray that scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities). This is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory, Artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator, with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock, with X-Ray it also helps to ensure food safety.  **You may have heard of the Solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack. In my professional opinion, the toolset JFrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security.** That is why I am very much a Bullfrog 🐂🐸. If there is interest, I will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one, this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very, very well going forward.  # Company background  They were founded in 2008 and there main product has been Artifactory ever since. It has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope, Sonatype Nexus, but Artifactory is better and cheaper. Sonatype started as a plugin for Artifactory that does something similar to X-Ray before X-Ray existed, then they copycatted the Universal Repo, so JFrog hit back with X-Ray. I have used both of these products over the years (since 2013) and I have worked in environments without, Artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company Intellectual Property.  Their product is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook. These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe**. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have over 90% renewal rate of their customers.  They acquired Shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory. Though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are Open Source.  Their focus lately has been on offering a SaaS model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier. This should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic.  They went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as Snowflake.  # Financials  I am including a couple of Comps here based on the segment they operate in. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software Team collaboration. I picked them as a comp because I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.  * As a high growth software company, unsurprisingly their GAAP earnings are negative. Surprisingly to me though, they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability.    * FROG: -$0.1861    * CRWD: -$0.4763    * TEAM: -$4.9355 * Their market cap    * FROG: $4.9 B    * CRWD: $47.8 B    * TEAM: $59.4 B * Their forward P/E Ratio    * FROG: 615    * CRWD: 771    * TEAM: 173 * They don’t have any long term debt * Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3 * Their margin is over 80% * Revenue is growing 44% YOY  # Ownership  65% owned by insiders and institutions  Most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Index Fund) that own it.  Their final lockup was just released on 2/16 after their earnings and insiders have through 3/13 to sell before they go back into lockup. This is similar to what happened with Palantir recently, but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell.  # TL;DR  They have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry. They are well managed and have good financials as well.  # Positions  420 shares and 61 options, I am planning to get 8 more options on Monday. If you haven't guessed yet, I like the stock. You can check my post history to see some YOLO posts from earlier this week. I will post another update when I am fully loaded with 420/69 to ride this 🚀  My EOY price target is at least $100/share from the current price which is at $53.49 on Friday.  # Fun Frog Fact  In 1992 Frogs were the first vertebrates to have sex in space.  &#x200B;  # Sources  The company's website  [https: jfrog.com](https: jfrog.com)  For research on financials I have used the Shwab's site, but you need to be a customer to access.

You can check my post history to see my YOLO, I have been buying up options between 65-80 with various dates over the past week and a half as the market has been drilling tech stocks hard.  I cannot recommend shit, but you can feel free to see what I am doing and make up your own mind if I am crazy or not. I mean... read OP’s post. They ended up bag holding from January and their lives were severely affected. Now in round 2 instead of recuperating losses or hedging or taking profits she decides to YOLO all in again.   Memes aside, yeah I’d dump her dumbass too. If bag holding GME impacts your life it means you way overextended. Not learning your lesson and to do it again? Yikes. Im not YOLOing, but I have enough in that if it doubled I’ll go pay the dog adoption fees at my local SPCA. Simply holding will never create a short squeeze. We need more buys than sells to drive the price up thus making it more expensive to continue shorting the stock. I understand most people have already YOLOed their accounts on this here, but we need more people to enter at highly leveraged positions. Too bad robinhood does not accept credit card payments for stock! Take out home equity lines of credit, apply for payday loans, sell your pokemon cards, give blow jobs behind a dumpster at Wendy's. Do whatever you can to buy up the price this week and a moonshot will be within reach. Simply waiting this out will allow the hedgies to cover their positions incrementally anytime the price dips when the public becomes disinterested in this stock and chases whatever else is out there. I swear to god you guys rip on me 13 or 14 more times I’m YOLOing GME puts. $120K $GME YOLO UPDATE: 1000 shares bought yesterday, 200 shares added today. We are going to the MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 GME YOLO UPDATE 2/26/21 - If I can hold you apes can hold too! 💎👐🏻🚀 RH does not let you transfer to a wallet. Figured i’d sell and YOLO on GME before deleting the RH app forever. Saw news flash that Robinhood might be filing a secret IPO around March. [News flair section also have posts about it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltduq8/only_time_we_can_support/).   Was trying to game out what to do should Robinhood goes IPO and reasons for actions.  a. Short: talk about poetic justice. Robinhood screwed retail investors in the GME squeeze and it is time to squeeze back. Besides, there are ample footings for shorting Robinhood. The GME squeeze has exposed Robinhood's shady practices and it is under a lot of watchful eyes. To file such a hasty IPO when it has not cleared its name yet may be a sign that early investors are already nervous about its prospects and they are trying to capitalize and exit early.   b. Long: regardless of all the shortfalls, Robinhood has broadened stock trading to an unprecedented level in this market. It still has a strong, loyal and ever expanding user base, including many in this subreddit. Revenue shot up more than 500% in 2020; even after the pandemic ebbs the habit of trading with Robinhood won't die out.   c. Just a normal stock. Not Boomer's favorite value stock, but not tendies or stonk either. Just something out there in the market. Maybe a stock to park some idle money, but won't expect a YOLO gain/loss.   d. Don't even want to touch it. Like ex-wife or ex-husband, better be gone and stay gone.  What would you do?"

TO THE MOON🚀🚀🌑🌑 AMC TO THE MOON 🚀🌕💎🖐 Been seeing a lot of comments in the past few days, “What’re the chances this is actually going to work?”-esq questions. Look, I’m not going to make you wrong for asking these types of questions because they are rational questions - but WSB wasn’t founded on rationality - it was founded on YOLOing our children’s college funds away and making memes about it. This is a MOONSHOT; not a sure bet - if you can’t handle the fire get out of the kitchen (aka sub to r/investing and get a nice safe index fund).  Here are the facts -> They NEED our shares. We are seeing them BLATANTLY use every trick in the book (naked shorts, keeping prices artificially low, blocking trading, etc) - in fact, they’re not even pretending or hiding it anymore. It’s out in the public - anyone who cares to see it can see it. But here’s the thing: despite all their tricks, at the end of the day - they still NEED our shares. At this point, it is a battle of attrition; they can only keep up their charade for so long before they literally have nothing left to short and they have to buy back their shorted positions (side note: I’m a retard and this prob isn’t exactly how it works but close enough so just fucking go with it for now). By holding (think Articuno chilling in cave [Seafoam Island] status) we lose NOTHING. If people keep buying/selling back and forth, it is playing into their hand. They want us to get bored and sell - behind all their dirty tricks, it sums up to them just trying to get us to sell - either through fear or boredom. Do what you got to do - but I am holding until the bitter fucking end.  Tldr; don’t get fatigue/boredom/fear from this - that’s what they want. Take time away and come back fresh. And most importantly - HOLD  Edit: Include specific location of Articuno’s YOLO spot  Edit 2: change “short ladder attack” to “keep prices artificially low” herp derp So I read WSB MOONDHOT NEED BLATANTLY NEED NOTHING HOLD YOLO  what did you guys see EXACT SAME HERE.  Except I have a wife and a dog, no job, living off unemployment, day old Reddit account, and a new love for wsb and everything you guys are doing.

Why? Because I drive a VW and can't get anywhere with GME. Except TO THE MOON!1!!1! Everyone buys in, some lose some win.  Them's the breaks.   CAPITALISM.  I MEAN MOON GME TO THE MOON. AMC TO THE MOON My portfolio was down 6k cause of meme stocks. Made 3 last call options just hoping to break even. Oh, and you'd think I'd learn my lesson and be happy with a massive gain? Wrong. My tendies went right back in, heading directly to the MOOOONNN!! I LIKE THE STOCK Reporting for duty Sir!!! To the MOOOONNNNNN🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌑 13 shares @ 243 and holding! WE ARE GOING TO THE MOON VTEC GONNA TAKE US TO THE MOON AND GME IS OUR FUEL!!!! You know what my dude, I think you’ve just made a sweet amount of unrealised profits. I got news that hundreds of thousands of call options ended in the money on Friday (Tendies for the buyers and huge costs to the sellers) so now these sellers will have to buy all of these hundreds of thousands of call options X 100. So there should be a sweet mini squeeze on the coming Monday, and the pressure just keeps building on from there. Don’t quote me though it’s just my opinion. GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 No no no don’t say that. By saying that you can have law suits up your ass from anyone who listened to you meaning that your basically making a risk free play for people as if they lose money they will sue you and get that money back no harm done! Unless you really have diamond balls and are an actual financial advisor then go for it. GME and AMC to the MOON regardless🚀🚀 Last Wednesday they did just that, ran it to 180 then BOOM, 140.  That is a large short.  They did it 3 times that day.  When you see the exact same run and drop multiple times in a day, that's a signature hedge fund short play.  Easy money for them and scares retail into selling.  Shills are also going after posts like this that tell what they are doing, nasty bunch, they hate that.  They believe apes will cave.  I'm holding. TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀 This is not financial advice, I barely can read. Not sure how you arrived at that conclusion. I only stated that Biden has ""just"" taken office. There is no way his team will let the market go belly up and have GME define his presidency. It won't happen. It's not about WHO the current president is but rather the overall climate of the country. Please enlighten me on what the worst situation is? What $200, $300 a share? You're out of your mind if you think this is going to sub $50 anytime soon.  Ape's WILL GET PAID AND LAND ON MOON.. Chicago and The Street will probably get bailed out and the wheels keep on turning. Stfu rly with 800 fucktards. 800 is srsly the fucking ezpz squeeze. Gamma squeeze will happen if we all just hold @ ezpz squeeze. And believe me gamma squeeze could go infinite. Set ur sell order at 69K or w/e. BE READY TO PUT UR MOONBOOTS ON CUZ GALAXIES ARS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS To the moon on monday. MOONDAY🚀🚀🚀 I loved how just last week (before the spike of course), we had some members of the WSB community making fun of $GME ""bagholders"" and telling us to ""let it go already"".  Well....IF YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE FOLKS FUCK YOU BECAUSE $GME & $AMC HODLERS ARE ON A ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON AND YOU'RE NOT INVITED SO GO SHILL SOMEWHERE ELSE. so spamming GME to the MOON! repeatedly is...good? This post will probably get buried, but whatever, it's funny.  I went into get tested for Covid this afternoon after being exposed, nothing special. But I'm also buying dips on AMC at the same time and as a result, almost missed my name being called multiple times by the receptionist when my turn was ready. Tunnel vision is real.  I get the swab and chat with the doc for a minute or two about all the Covid craziness and just overall life shit. He's a cool guy, super laid back and what not, and after a bit he steps out to go find my results. I'm chillin in the exam room, waiting for my results and of course, I'm still on my apps, just habitually watching the price and debating if I should go in on some more or not. About five or six minutes go by when my doctor returns with results. I didn't realize he could see the basic idea of what I was doing on my phone (price-watching etc) and as he passes me, I hear him say, ""Niiiiiice.""  Being in the exam room and awaiting my results, I chime in with, ""Oh sweet, I'm negative?"" He responds with, ""Nah, I saw the stonks on your phone. Good luck, retard."" There's a pause in the air before he mentions Reddit and WSB, just to laugh off a potential HR issue calling a patient a retard, Turns out he's here somewhere in the 9 million strong pulling for us and has been holding strong and buying the dips too.  Anyways, TL;DR: My doctor said ""good luck, retard"" while catching me buying dips on AMC and he's here somewhere in the WSB crowd.  Diamond hands, Covid neg, TO THE MOON WE GO! FUCK THE MOON WE’RE GOING TO MARS 🚀🚀 The Post Earnings RKT Play - ROCKET TO THE MOON (Tendie Time) **TL;DR RKT is going to bull run all the way to the 9th March after its beautiful earnings and it's time to burn some shorts.**  Yesterday pre-earnings I posted some [DD](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsdpuz/rkt_to_the_moon_dd_and_short_squeeze_opportunity/) on why RKT (Rocket Companies) was a buy. I was right, the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10% from highs of a 20% gain during the day. To someone that has not followed RKT this may seem like a missed opportunity. WRONG. Welcome to the Amazon of the Finance World (well near enough).  Rocket by all traditional measures should've risen to $25 (previous close of $19.90) minimum today. Their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past. Practically since the IPO institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls, some covered, some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between $19 and $21 or to average down from a bag holding position above. These players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase (a potential gamma squeeze if it did so). Hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below $22.  **Next week, things start to change...**  But before that let's just go over the insane earnings they just report:  1. **EPS $1.09** (analyst prediction $0.87) an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from $754 million to $2.84 billion. 2. A **special dividend of $1.11** per share to Class A common stock holders on March 9th (note this is important autists). 3. **Partnerships with a multitude of companies including JP Morgan**. 4. Stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended. 5. There's more little nuggets but that's enough for ape brain to take in.  **So what happens next week?**  Firstly the dividend at current stock price is just over **5% yield**. An insane amount. This provides a catalyst for the price in two ways. Firstly, who doesn't want any easy 5% return? This is hardly priced in let's be realistic. These earnings give RKT as **PE of 5**. Way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around **3 to 4 times too small** if you consider them a Fintech.  More importantly, let's have a look at RKT's **short interest**. It lies somewhere between 35% and 40%. Now let's be clear this isn't going to be a Reddit, retail investor driven **short squeeze**, RKT has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million BUT if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure. Shorts have to pay the dividend - an instant 5% loss is not a good look and who knows if there'll be more to come in later earnings. With call holders less in the equation, the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies. It's time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the IPO.  Everyone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover, and 40% of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me. A huge difference between RKT and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above $30 indefinitely (or higher). Shorts don't like to be stuck indefinitely losing, unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse - not that they will unless you all have weak hands. Expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around $30+ to drive the price up more.  With all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of March. I have a genuine PT after that earnings of $40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ship's favour the moon is only the beginning. This Rocket is going up Uranus like your wife's boyfriend's is up hers.  Rocket is recruiting diamond hands, I am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10% profit BUT autists and apes we can get 100%, 200% or more!  RKT closed at $21.85 today. It is my firm believe RKT is a **brilliant buy** after these earnings under $24 and if the bull run starts all the way to $30. Management want these shorts out and that's good enough for me, the CEO laughed at the shorts on CNBC.  I am willing to put my money where my mouth is as I averaged up from $30 per cent equivalent CfD contracts at $20.30 to $41 per cent equivalent at $20.91.  In other words get us to $46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade. These values are actually GBP but I presumed you only know dollar due to autism.  **I just like the stock. So buy shares, squeeze shorts.**  **RKT TO THE MOON!**  [Earnings Call Transcript](https: www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/)  EDIT: VERY IMPORTANT POINT - some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95% is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion not far off GME. Just more reason to buy  Disclaimer: This is not financial advise and should not be taken as such.

IPO,56,2103," Can OnlyFans just do an IPO already? I know like 5 or 6 women that are doing it and they're like 6 or 7's at best. If they're raking in that much cash on average women fingerbanging themselves and riding dragon dildos, I want to make some money off these sad lonely fucks in their mom's basement I love it. 💎💎🙌🏻🙌🏻🚀🚀   https: finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/3-us-regulators-probing-robinhood-093756575.html  How crazy is that - Robinhood plans an IPO worth over $20 biiion dollars!!!! Holy Chit!!! I was on the phone with Fidelity customer service last week.  Long time Fidelity customer here, and I wanted to try my hand at option trading, but I accidentally turned on margin trading and had to call to get that removed.  Anyway, the rep and I were chatting while he was doing stuff and he mentioned to me that he's been doing nothing but this kind of request because of transferring RH customers that had margin trading on by default and didn't even know until they switched.  Then he also mentioned that Fidelity had more new accounts in 2021 so far -- in 6 weeks -- **than all of 2020**.  Now, Fidelity is a large ass company.  The fact that they got 10x the normal flow of new customers mostly because of RH doesn't sound great for the future of RH.   Puts on RH IPO. 100% agree. If they're dumb enough to IPO - they're gonna get burned hard. All the apes will be shorting the fuck out of them RH is going to get a rude awakening on IPO day Bets on RH IPO short interest beating GME short interest? What do you think Robinhood's IPO would come out at? Sub $35? I still can't believe bumble started at $70 for a dating app. I like fidelity trader pro software but good luck trading via the app. Just in time for the Roblox IPO You left out the most likely scenario IF this actually rockets and we get screwed.  The SEC steps in and halts everything related to GME.  No trading at all.    They acknowledge the huge price has the potential to send the whole market spiraling as funds and brokers would go bankrupt.  They come up with a ""fair"" price the short holders must pay into a fund, take your shares from you at that price, pay you put of said fund,  and then a month or two down the line release those shares back into the wild at a set price similar to an IPO.    They'll let this game go on for a while, and they may even let it get up to high hundreds or a thousand per share but they won't let the whole market burn over this.  $69,420 per share isn't happening.  I'm getting out before it does anyway.  Once it hits the absolute peak you can smash the sell button all you want on the way down.  Doubtful you'll get matched with a buyer at $50k and falling. **""tHiS iS nOt FiNaNcIaL aDvIsE""**  **31-Mar-2021 we will see an IPO of Robinhood.**   [RH Company Profile](https: pitchbook.com/profiles/company/57227-95)  To me, Robinhood is generally perceived as hated from several retail traders, a mass emigration from their platform is occurring due to them being rat fucks.. and ya'll autist shits know that the rats get the bats..  furthermore all I see is posts about stocks going to the moon, and never anything about stocks getting yoinked into the fucking abyss, maybe it's time to show all these new degenerates of wallstreetbets what shorting is... just a thought. Sadly the amount of free advertising they’ve received from the media attention surrounding all this means their IPO will likely be hugely successful. No publicity is bad publicity - the general public has a very short memory soon just the company name and logo will be stuck in their heads without the negative connotations Some other guy said close accounts en masse after IPO which seems like a more effective protest I hope the IPO is going to hell. Don´t waste any money or time for RH ... The Robinhood IPO will almost certainly be a success. I personally moved from RH to Fidelity after January and I know a lot of people here did too. But we are not the entire retail market. Plenty of retail traders didn't have a stake in GME so they will stay with RH. The only people moving from RH are those that are involved enough to track GME daily and watch the congressional hearing (a lot of people, but not enough to hurt the IPO). The reality of the matter is that RH has the absolute best UI for mobile trading and it will stay that way until Fidelity puts serious effort into their UI because as of right now their mobile app kinda sucks, but its desktop version is better than RH. Besides, do you really think Citadel would let the RH IPO tank? robinhood IPO could be a trap, they will throw a WSB hated company in hopes people will try to short to the ground, they might try to create a hype with bot accounts. so when there is enough short position by WSB, hedgies send it to moon to swap your GMEs with RH shorts. just some tinfoil talking robinhood IPO could be a trap, they will throw a WSB hated company in hopes people will try to short to the ground, they might try to create a hype with bot accounts. so when there is enough short position by WSB, hedgies send it to moon to swap your GMEs with RH shorts. just some tinfoil talking RKT IPOed last year, they're actually profitable and making a shit load of money. They killed earnings and gave a special dividen out (all this during a dam pandemin). Where you not around when RKT was like the top meme stock on this sub for like a good 2 weeks? RKT is a good companie, I sold my FDs last Fri for a good profit.  Possitions 900shares of GME on margin and selling weekly FDs to all you retards I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.  By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.  Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/  First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!!   Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink.   Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here.   By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.  Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.  When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.  UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!  Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.  Space Ape out  TLDR:   * $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU * $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI * $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot * $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds * $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon  EDIT: Fresh data in.... Added Wendys and the 100k moon prediction Petco! Ticker= WOOF They recently had IPO and the stock is at atl. They have a good online store as well as a strong brick and mortar chain. Probably not a short squeeze play but I can see WOOF a good long-term play. I was following this too.  I only just jumped into this investing game.  Since they're not doing an IPO, but a direct offering, is there any real difference?  Or will we be able to buy shares that morning? Yeah, and retail is 1/4 of the investing money. If they do the IPO and price it right, aware of the outflow of users, then the institutional investors will make bank on the other side of that short.   I'm not going to short companies for activist reasons. I'll lose, and that's now how I get my Tesla. Bought $PLTR Shares beginning from the IPO date. Currently holding 3950 shares and placed some limit buy orders if it dips further. https: finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/3-us-regulators-probing-robinhood-093756575.html  Read this!!!     Crazy that Robinhood going IPO on a 20 billion valuation.... crazy... OP left out a buncha things. I think he ran out of crayons:   * The $1.11 special dividend is screwing  the shorts. If they own the stock til the dividend date, they have to pay the dividend to the folks they borrowed from. * RKT doesn't need the fucking money. They're profitable as fuck. They only did an IPO to allow insiders to have liquidity and/or acquire other companies. * Nearly all the time when a company is shorted, they expect it to lose money, or it's overpriced. Like I said, they don't need the money. However RKT did just have a huge 3rd quarter (and 2020) due to refinancings, so next year won't be as profitable. But they're still growing fast. * The lockup period for insiders to sell their stock came and went. No one sold, they know the stock is worth more.  * Main risk for a mortgage company is rising interest rates. The fed has said they'll [maintain the low rates until 2022](https: www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/fed-meeting-decision-interest-rates.html) * Because of the buyback program, the stock can't go down much. If it does, they'll BUY IT BACK. Stupid shorts, how are you going to make money if it the company will prevent it from going lower?  I personally think the special dividend was a FU to the shorts, and they'll start their buyback leading up to the dividend as a FU twice. So unlike GME we aren't relying on paper hands to squeeze the squoze. There's a billion dollars of squeezy-squeezy coming. We just don't know if it'll squeeze quick or slow.  Even if nothing happens, the likelihood of the stock going down is as small as your pecker in freezing ice cold water in the middle of winter. If you're going to try f'ing the big shorts, don't you want to practice safe sex?  I also like the stock. Will be holding long term anyway. They have really aggressive expansion plans which will pay off for years. Were you here when it IPOd? Replace GME of today with RKT of then and that's what this board looked like. WSB was RKT crazy when it IPOd. I have been in since shortly after IPO so nice to see it get some attention again. They sure were during the IPO. It had a nice run then. I'm sure they said that about amazon too back in 2001, strange how a 1 year IPO looks stagnant before it isn't My understanding from reading the IPO prospectus is that Rocket has to hold the mortgages they write for up to a month before they can be sold to the GSE's. The company is effectively using debt as bridge financing to cover that period. Since they have a guaranteed buyer for these loans, I don't think the debt is a huge problem. well don't support RH just out of principal my friend lost out $40k in profile on GME from the first squeeze. During the hearing it was obvious they are in this for themselves and not the consumers, which as a business that's what they should go for to maximize the profile. However, if growing/protecting your business by harming your customer is not ethical and sadly the government will not do anything about it if anything just a light fine and probably won't see jail time tied to it. I hold when they do go IPO in march that everyone in WSB use every means to short the fuck out of RH and burn that shit to the ground. Yes, according to the hearing it was the gamma squeeze that caused RH to halt trades as it did not have enough capital to paid the fee to the clearing house and not enough shares in the open market to cover the call options and this may have resulted in bankruptcy for many financial institutional. But if they did make this mistake they should go into bankruptcy as for incompetency for allowing such thing to happen. Why do these billionaires have some special treatment when you see normal people who can't pay their bills they will receive foreclosure, credit balance closed, and if they fuck up at work they will be unemployed. This should be applied to the society as a whole and not just for the common people. Instead of shorting just close your account after IPO. What does ""confidential IPO"" mean? would someone be kind enough to monkey explain what an IPO is and what the implications are? Sounds like GME/meme stocks might make them go bankrupt without this rushed IPO liquidity injection. Sure other platforms also halted but if the majority of apes are on Robinhood, which going off screenshots here it looks like a lot of apes are on RH yolo’ing on OTM options that return 1000+ return gains, then maybe they’re not ready for paying out the shareholders. Story might end up as a bankrun of RH but in a form of paying out GME shareholders until they can no longer and go bankrupt....any thoughts? Step 1: wait for the IPO   Step 2: RH most shorted stock ever, just by retail investors But guys, what if we short them and accidentally trigger a GME-like short squeeze on RH IPO What the fuck does the ""P"" stand for in a March ""confidential"" IPO that Bloomberg posts about in February ?? True but I would wait for a few weeks until the hedgies are done feasting and take a short position. Robinhood is pretty stupid for not postponing the IPO until the smoke from this dumpster fire is extinguished. They have a pretty big PR nightmare on their hands. The IPO itself will probably be given to banks, funds and other people who will be the only ones to have access to their financial information.  However, everyone else will be able to buy the stock after, just not at the IPO price, but whatever price it has taken since then... It stands for ""Initial Public Offering"" and means that they will list their stock on the stock market.  The IPO itself is the INITIAL offering, and usually only banks, funds or employees will have access to the IPO price, however everyone will be able to trade the stock after. Thank you.   It seems the majority of idiots on r/wallstreetbets don't understand how an IPO works.  Only employees with stock options, and those they let in (family, friends, etc.) have access to the initial stock offering price.  And employees with options may eventually exercise a much lower strike price.  There is usually a waiting period. ***Translated from Chinese text *** so it’s kinda fucked up but info is here    It was disclosed at that time that in terms of equity structure, Ant Group contributed 4 billion yuan to 50% of the shares, Nanshang Bank accounted for 15.01 percent of the shares, Cathay Pacific Shihua accounted for 10% of shares, Ningde Times accounted for 8% of shares, Qianfang Technology accounted for 7.01% of shares, and Hua Finance Industry and Yuyue Medical accounted for 4.99% of shares, respectively. Yuyue Medical, as a general funder, plans to contribute 399 million yuan with its own funds. The board of directors of Ants for the elimination of money is composed of seven directors, and the board of supervisors is composed of five supervisors, including representative supervisors of employees and shareholders' supervisors.  If the above information is true, it means that the seven major shareholders who spend money in Chongqing Ant will further increase the proportion of registered capital. Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance will carry out consumer finance-related business after its establishment. The business scope is: RMB business: (1) issuing personal consumption loans; (2) accepting deposits from domestic subsidiaries and domestic shareholders; (3) borrowing from domestic financial institutions; (4) issuing approved financial bonds; (5) domestic Interactual lending; (6) consulting and agency business related to consumer finance; (7) acting as an agent to sell insurance products related to consumer loans; (8) fixed-income securities investment business; and (9) other business approved by the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.  It should be pointed out that the news that Ants were approved for fund-raising was coming out at a time when the Ant Group Sprint Science and Technology Innovation Board and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange were on the market. With the suspension of the ant group's IPO last November, there has been no public progress in the news about ant's money-removing. In a report at the time last September, Financial Tiger pointed out that the approval of the establishment of Ant Fund-Ran will bring about great changes to its current consumer lending business of the group, and does not even rule out the possibility of future divestiture or business restructuring. There is also the possibility of dividing flowers and borrowing into Ant Consumer Gold in the future.  It is also analyzed that Ant Group's original consumption finance-related business is facing certain public opinion pressure. The contradiction mainly focuses on its leverage ratio and the risk of excessive concentration of business. The acquisition of money-free licenses has a significant benefit in mitigating such risks. In addition, with the implementation of the new regulations on the supervision of small lenders, Ant Group can gradually transfer some of its consumer financial business through small loan companies to consumer finance companies to enhance business compliance and sustainability.  On September 14 last year, industrial and commercial changes occurred in Chongqing Ant Shangcheng Small Loan Co., Ltd. and Hua, the main operating entities Chongqing Ant Xiaowei Micro Loan Co., Ltd. and Hangzhou Ant Future Technology Co., Ltd., and the holding parent companies of the three companies are all limited shares of Zhejiang Ant Micro Financial Services Group. The division was officially changed to Ant Group. At the same time, Yu Shengfa, the legal person and chairman of the two main operating companies, withdrew and changed to Huang Hao. Hu Xi, the former legal person, executive director and general manager of Hangzhou Ant, withdrew and changed to Ni Xingjun.  With the change of the regulatory environment of financial technology, after Ant Group's IPO was suspended, there was a lot of industry attention about how its business would be reorganized. According to the previous prospectus data of Ant Group, its lending business has developed into its largest source of income. In the first half of 2020, its loan revenue increased by 59% to Rmb29 billion, accounting for 40% of the group's total revenue. Ant Financial has more than 700 million Alipay users per month, and it puts cooperation with traditional banks at the core of its strategy. In the 12 months to June 2020, its loan platform has granted credit to about 500 million people, and the annualized interest rate charged for smaller loans is about 15%. Borrowing money similar to credit cards and unsecured consumer loan products was the basis of Ant Group's plan to seek a valuation of $225 billion in the upcoming IPO.  Ant Group has been interviewed twice by regulators before. According to the content of the second interview, one of them is to improve corporate governance and strictly rectify illegal credit, insurance, financial management and other financial activities in accordance with prudential supervision requirements. Since then, news about the business reorganization and rectification of Ant Group has been circulating in the market.  In late December last year, two people directly familiar with the matter said that Ant Group was considering integrating most of its online financial business into a holding company, including the consumer loan business. In early January this year, it was reported that Ant Group was planning to restructure its consumer credit business in order to continue to lend nationwide under  It was disclosed at that time that in terms of equity structure, Ant Group contributed 4 billion yuan to 50% of the shares, Nanshang Bank accounted for 15.01 percent of the shares, Cathay Pacific Shihua accounted for 10% of shares, Ningde Times accounted for 8% of shares, Qianfang Technology accounted for 7.01% of shares, and Hua Finance Industry and Yuyue Medical accounted for 4.99% of shares, respectively.

In early January this year, it was reported that Ant Group was planning to restructure its consumer credit business in order to continue to lend nationwide under new regulations, otherwise it might severely restrict Ant Group's most profitable business. This is part of an ant group's comprehensive assessment of its corporate structure. Ants hope to gradually shift their main consumer credit business to a new consumer financial sector with the power to operate nationwide, according to people familiar with the matter. In theory, switching to the consumer financial sector will enable Ant Group to continue lending nationwide without waiting for a new license plate.  Alibaba revealed in the financial report on February 2 that there was a major uncertainty about Ant Group's IPO plan, and Ant Group contributed $735 million in profits in the third quarter. Also in early February, it was reported that Ant Group planned to divest its consumer credit data business, and Ant Group became a more tightly regulated financial holding company, which was a key part of Ant Group's business restructuring. Ant Group declined to comment.  Zhang Yong, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors and CEO, said in a financial teleconference on February 3 that once Ant Group has completed the relevant regulatory procedures for approving the plan, market information will be updated in time. Financial tiger also noted at that time that when talking about Ant Group's consumer credit business, Zhang Yong pointed out that in China's retail market, payments made with flowers account for only a small proportion of the total credit amount, and the vast majority of consumers associate their payment accounts with multiple sources of funding, including credit cards. It's just one of the financing channels. Although the changing regulatory environment applicable to financial technology and Internet platform companies poses recent challenges to Alibaba, it believes that it is an important opportunity to reassess and improve business practices.  I believe that there will be an answer soon as to what plan Ant Group will restructure and where the consumer credit business will eventually go. For me, I wasn't excited about Ant or AliPay being cashless it was more about how profitable/lucrative it would be with such a large market and growing chinese middle class.  I worry that the pulling the IPO last year, re-educating Jack Ma, and some of the public sabre rattling in December was the CCP's way of saying they want a big cut.  I am still hodling my BABA shares, but have been disappointed that it is kind of stuck going sideways and always at the mercy of the CCP. Not gonna lie. I’m buying RH IPO. # 🐸 is getting ready to leap.  This is my first DD post so I would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions I am making here. But I thing that JFrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why.  # What do they do?  Their main product is JFrog Artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries (runnable code) and it also serves as a mirror repository - local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer JFrog X-Ray that scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities). This is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory, Artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator, with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock, with X-Ray it also helps to ensure food safety.  **You may have heard of the Solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack. In my professional opinion, the toolset JFrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security.** That is why I am very much a Bullfrog 🐂🐸. If there is interest, I will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one, this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very, very well going forward.  # Company background  They were founded in 2008 and there main product has been Artifactory ever since. It has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope, Sonatype Nexus, but Artifactory is better and cheaper. Sonatype started as a plugin for Artifactory that does something similar to X-Ray before X-Ray existed, then they copycatted the Universal Repo, so JFrog hit back with X-Ray. I have used both of these products over the years (since 2013) and I have worked in environments without, Artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company Intellectual Property.  Their product is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook. These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe**. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have over 90% renewal rate of their customers.  They acquired Shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory. Though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are Open Source.  Their focus lately has been on offering a SaaS model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier. This should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic.  They went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as Snowflake.  # Financials  I am including a couple of Comps here based on the segment they operate in. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software Team collaboration. I picked them as a comp because I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.  * As a high growth software company, unsurprisingly their GAAP earnings are negative. Surprisingly to me though, they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability.    * FROG: -$0.1861    * CRWD: -$0.4763    * TEAM: -$4.9355 * Their market cap    * FROG: $4.9 B    * CRWD: $47.8 B    * TEAM: $59.4 B * Their forward P/E Ratio    * FROG: 615    * CRWD: 771    * TEAM: 173 * They don’t have any long term debt * Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3 * Their margin is over 80% * Revenue is growing 44% YOY  # Ownership  65% owned by insiders and institutions  Most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Index Fund) that own it.  Their final lockup was just released on 2/16 after their earnings and insiders have through 3/13 to sell before they go back into lockup. This is similar to what happened with Palantir recently, but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell.  # TL;DR  They have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry. They are well managed and have good financials as well.  # Positions  420 shares and 61 options, I am planning to get 8 more options on Monday. If you haven't guessed yet, I like the stock. You can check my post history to see some YOLO posts from earlier this week. I will post another update when I am fully loaded with 420/69 to ride this 🚀  My EOY price target is at least $100/share from the current price which is at $53.49 on Friday.  # Fun Frog Fact  In 1992 Frogs were the first vertebrates to have sex in space.  &#x200B;  # Sources  The company's website  [https: jfrog.com](https: jfrog.com)  For research on financials I have used the Shwab's site, but you need to be a customer to access.

If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).

In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

I've been lurking here since 2018.  I've been an active WSB community since mid-2019. I remember when WSB was just another Reddit sub with 300,000 members.  I've watched the community storylines of WSB grow greater in grandeur. I'm tempted to call WSB a household name.  What makes WSB so unique from the hundreds, maybe thousands, of stock message boards out there is that the v loose comradery that unites this community together. WSB now affects real change.  So what's next?  WSB likes GameSt0nk. We do not like Robbinhood. So when Robinhood IPOs we should steer clear right? Wrong. The Robbinhood IPO opens the door for new ownership and therefore new leadership. WSB could own and operate Robinhood. We'll have to wait for the details of the IPO, but simply put we could own it.  This would be achieved by accumulating enough stock and then WSB coming together as a minority (or majority) shareholder group. Next is voting rights, then a board member, and eventually a new CEO. This won't happen quickly though...just like the other stonk we all like, it'll be a lengthy war of attrition. It's still worth it though. If you're doing it right, D14m0nd1ng a stonk forever should be effortless.  TL;DR - buying Robbinhood shares might be the contrarian play that we need right now.  PS - Before anyone spouts off about Robbinhood reading this and now being wise to the idea, settle down. You'd be out of your hair brained, ape mind if you think they hadn't thought about something along these lines pre IPO. Well have to wait for the details but with 10m members, it shouldn't be very difficult to own a major chunk.  Positions:CLDR $25c for 1/23ET $8c for 7/21  EDIT: I don't think they'll sell off a majority in the IPO..but who knows. They need a lot of money, billions. They may be just stoopid enough to sell a majority to the public at IPO. What's the reason behind the confidential IPO? Regardless, at some stage insiders will sell and/or they'll need to raise more money. They could eventually end up selling off a majority stake. On the other hand, by WSB holding a significant amount of available shares, we could force them to dilute their company into nothingness because if they ever sold a majority, WSB could quite literally own it and then we're one step closer to that WSB hedgefund that was always a joke, but now a real possibility. Lastly, the shareholder meetings at Robinhood would serve as a great WSB convention. I know this idea isn't popular, especially not right now. I wanted to put it out there anyway.  Edit 2: It is vlad. You got me guys. Sorry about burning all of you over and over again. Does anyone know if this year is a leap year? I hope my app doesn't go down again or whatever. But in the end, I don't really care. Can I get a ban? what the hell? they intend to IPO?   I need more info. I can see Vlad stepping down after going public; makes millions from the IPO, sells the rest at the end of lock up **TL;DR RKT is going to bull run all the way to the 9th March after its beautiful earnings and it's time to burn some shorts.**  Yesterday pre-earnings I posted some [DD](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsdpuz/rkt_to_the_moon_dd_and_short_squeeze_opportunity/) on why RKT (Rocket Companies) was a buy. I was right, the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10% from highs of a 20% gain during the day. To someone that has not followed RKT this may seem like a missed opportunity. WRONG. Welcome to the Amazon of the Finance World (well near enough).  Rocket by all traditional measures should've risen to $25 (previous close of $19.90) minimum today. Their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past. Practically since the IPO institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls, some covered, some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between $19 and $21 or to average down from a bag holding position above. These players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase (a potential gamma squeeze if it did so). Hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below $22.  **Next week, things start to change...**  But before that let's just go over the insane earnings they just report:  1. **EPS $1.09** (analyst prediction $0.87) an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from $754 million to $2.84 billion. 2. A **special dividend of $1.11** per share to Class A common stock holders on March 9th (note this is important autists). 3. **Partnerships with a multitude of companies including JP Morgan**. 4. Stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended. 5. There's more little nuggets but that's enough for ape brain to take in.  **So what happens next week?**  Firstly the dividend at current stock price is just over **5% yield**. An insane amount. This provides a catalyst for the price in two ways. Firstly, who doesn't want any easy 5% return? This is hardly priced in let's be realistic. These earnings give RKT as **PE of 5**. Way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around **3 to 4 times too small** if you consider them a Fintech.  More importantly, let's have a look at RKT's **short interest**. It lies somewhere between 35% and 40%. Now let's be clear this isn't going to be a Reddit, retail investor driven **short squeeze**, RKT has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million BUT if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure. Shorts have to pay the dividend - an instant 5% loss is not a good look and who knows if there'll be more to come in later earnings. With call holders less in the equation, the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies. It's time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the IPO.  Everyone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover, and 40% of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me. A huge difference between RKT and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above $30 indefinitely (or higher). Shorts don't like to be stuck indefinitely losing, unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse - not that they will unless you all have weak hands. Expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around $30+ to drive the price up more.  With all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of March. I have a genuine PT after that earnings of $40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ship's favour the moon is only the beginning. This Rocket is going up Uranus like your wife's boyfriend's is up hers.  Rocket is recruiting diamond hands, I am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10% profit BUT autists and apes we can get 100%, 200% or more!  RKT closed at $21.85 today. It is my firm believe RKT is a **brilliant buy** after these earnings under $24 and if the bull run starts all the way to $30. Management want these shorts out and that's good enough for me, the CEO laughed at the shorts on CNBC.  I am willing to put my money where my mouth is as I averaged up from $30 per cent equivalent CfD contracts at $20.30 to $41 per cent equivalent at $20.91.  In other words get us to $46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade. These values are actually GBP but I presumed you only know dollar due to autism.  **I just like the stock. So buy shares, squeeze shorts.**  **RKT TO THE MOON!**  [Earnings Call Transcript](https: www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/)  EDIT: VERY IMPORTANT POINT - some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95% is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion not far off GME. Just more reason to buy  Disclaimer: This is not financial advise and should not be taken as such. (SEC scares me)  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/t4b0ga009wj61.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=988cbd4e0b73580ab34b8bdd4fbe20efac64b9af Been holding since IPO. This is a company you can’t lose with long term. But I totally agree toward the dividend date we should get a lot of people piling in for the easy money and hopefully fuck all the short interest while we’re at it. Saw news flash that Robinhood might be filing a secret IPO around March. [News flair section also have posts about it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltduq8/only_time_we_can_support/).   Was trying to game out what to do should Robinhood goes IPO and reasons for actions.  a. Short: talk about poetic justice. Robinhood screwed retail investors in the GME squeeze and it is time to squeeze back. Besides, there are ample footings for shorting Robinhood. The GME squeeze has exposed Robinhood's shady practices and it is under a lot of watchful eyes. To file such a hasty IPO when it has not cleared its name yet may be a sign that early investors are already nervous about its prospects and they are trying to capitalize and exit early.   b. Long: regardless of all the shortfalls, Robinhood has broadened stock trading to an unprecedented level in this market. It still has a strong, loyal and ever expanding user base, including many in this subreddit. Revenue shot up more than 500% in 2020; even after the pandemic ebbs the habit of trading with Robinhood won't die out.   c. Just a normal stock. Not Boomer's favorite value stock, but not tendies or stonk either. Just something out there in the market. Maybe a stock to park some idle money, but won't expect a YOLO gain/loss.   d. Don't even want to touch it. Like ex-wife or ex-husband, better be gone and stay gone.  What would you do? I think the issue is that only 5% of the stock is available in float due to how they structured the IPO. Literally half of the entire float is traded in volume each day, which makes for big swings.  With 40% short interest, this thing could squeeze big time. That's not to say that a squeeze is a reason to buy this, it's just a cherry on top. In **RKT DD Part I**, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. **Refer to RKT DD Part I Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)  In **RKT DD Part II** I discuss Rocket’s infectious culture from an employee’s (my own) perspective and why it will allow them to be the Amazon on Fintech. **Refer to RKT DD Part II Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt\_dd\_part\_ii\_a\_former\_employees\_take\_on\_rockets/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt_dd_part_ii_a_former_employees_take_on_rockets/)     **RKT DD PART III:**  Now I want to address you dumbasses who lump Rocket in with United Wholesale Mortgage Company and Loan Depot.  *LoOk HoW LoAn DePoT aNd UwMc ArE DoInG – MoRtGaGe CoMpAnIeS SuCk*  Listen you simpletons, Rocket Companies OWNS THE ENTIRE HOUSING ECOSYSTEM:  * From the Front end with their **Rocket Homes** business (Zillow, Redfin competitor) * To the origination of the loan via **Rocket Mortgage** (whether direct to consumer or through their broker channel) * To their **Amrock** title insurance business which orders the appraisals and title insurance * To their **Nexsys Solutions** with tools that allow for Remote Online Notarization, enabling the mortgage process to be 100% digital * And with their **servicing business** which allows them to think about their clients on a lifetime perspective rather than on just a transactional level.  As they continue to grow their entire housing ecosystem, they are also leveraging their tech platform for other ancillary businesses such as Rocket Loans and Rocket Auto.  Link to all of Rocket’s companies below:  [https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/](https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/)  **Let’s talk Rocket Auto:**  Investors mistakenly think that Rocket Auto hasn’t launched Yet. It’s true Rocket Auto hasn’t launched *publicly* but it doesn’t mean Rocket Auto hasn’t launched. **Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales, marketing and customer service.** Rocket even powers their e-commerce platform. They literally run every part of Vroom’s business except for the delivery of the vehicle.  If you look at VROOM’s 10Q, you’ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4-year agreement with VRM. The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8,641,914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four-year period, in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket’s e-commerce platform. That’s $430M worth of shares. Let’s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom (2015) so we don’t even know how much he already owns. See section of Vroom’s 10Q below:  *Paragraph in VRM 10Q: “On May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Rocket”) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the “Rocket Auto” brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the “RA Agreement”). The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform, but all sales of the Company’s inventory will be conducted through the Company’s platform.* ***Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2021*** *and, during the term of the RA Agreement, Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory. The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company’s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement.* ***The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period*** *based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.”*  As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter…and **what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday’s earnings report?** A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don’t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted.  I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom – why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn’t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it’s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly.  **Why is used car sales good for Rocket?**  Because Data, Data, Data.  Rocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans  Rocket can very easily have access to half of America’s homeowners credit reports by 2030 – The jackpot of consumer data.  What does a credit report tell you? **It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off.** This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform.  Look at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana’s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket’s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket’s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus – to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world’s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate.  Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes **1 million decisions per day** and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions.  Not to mention, ***Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales***\*\*.\*\* We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep – and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana’s presence.  **Rocket Homes:**  *WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW:*  Dear smooth brain, please download “Rocket Homes” on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow.  I’ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won’t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes.  I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket’s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial).  Not going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B – A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET’s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED.  **Rocket’s expansion internationally:**  Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B.  We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country.  Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket’s Lendesk fits the Bill.  Unfortunately these dumbass mods won’t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/) Link below:  [https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  This international expansion (along with Rocket’s other ancillary businesses) highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started.  **Short Squeeze**  Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares – but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares.  Despite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market.  To combat this unnecessary shorting, **Rocket announced a $1B buyback**; currently their float is $2B.  First off, who even announces a buyback when they’ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of.  Rocket’s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday’s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover?  Initially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn’t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn’t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August – that’s how much he believes in this company.  Gilbert has a big ego – so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron’s Fathead to Benedict Arnold’s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America’s biggest traitor*. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below:  [https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/](https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/)  This was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect.  Just like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I’m sure he’s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close).  Fun fact – even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James’ departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship… Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000](https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000)  **But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren’t they buying back shares at these these levels?**  Answer: because they likely can’t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain.  According to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading.  What is material information? Material information is any information that hasn’t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released.  What is Rocket's ""non-public material information"":  * The announcement of Rocket’s big, new financial partner * The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto  This information is likely to be made public on Thursday’s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float. And to put fuel on the fire, Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back, that is, if there are any shares left for purchase.  Gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs, imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into.  Say it with me now: Rocket Bears are Fucked.  TDLR: this doesn’t contain even a fraction of the information in this DD part three (or DD part one and two) but this dude does a good job summarizing RKT’s situation.

SHO,55,44651," I think you are focused too much on the shorts and not on the hedge funds who are also betting with us (not for the cause, but because they have been squeezing GameStop long before DFV got involved). GME is a meme stock. It does not operate the normal stocks do. It’s demand randomly surpasses its supply and that’s what causes spikes. What will cause the squeeze is the enormous demand pending after mid March while the stock is STILL shorted. Let me put it this was way:  You are a hedge fund and shorted gme. You are also a hedge fund and bought calls knowing the stock will rise because of a sudden movement that is driving demand through the roof. You wager that you can make money on the rise AND the dip this way. Why else do you think the the hedges jumped back in? GameStop is the company that produces infinite milk as long as you “squeeze” the udders (pun intended). They have been doing this for years. It won’t stop till the gamma squeeze happens.   I’m not telling you to buy the stock. I’m just explaining in simple terms why you SHOULD. :) Maybe a little bit of both honestly.... I think initially they were on the losing side big time and I’m almost 100% certain that they covered quite a bit when people were unable to purchase shares of conveniently restricted companies on many different platforms and market manipulation was rampant only allowing people to sell and not buy and raising margin requirements forcing positions to be closed and driving the price Down I saw a very similar thing happened in 2011 when Silver and Gold Hit all time highs and they raised margin requirements on SLV AND GLD many times over in order to suppress the price and force people to close positions and it worked That combined with the FEDS quantitative easing and buying mortgage backed securities to keep interest rates low and money cheap encouraging spending to give this false illusion that the economy is fine and running on all cylinders.... Anyway no one can know for certain if the hedge funds have been buying call positions to cover their shorts, I’m almost certain they are,.... however it might not just be the hedge funds that are shorting the stocks any longer I feel like a lot more retail investors also started shorting these stocks just as much as the people who are buying it and one thing is for certain stock can go infinitely higher but it only can go so low, plus with all the exposure all over the Internet and television/news outlets over the past 2 months talking about these meme stocks being a joke they might as well just be encouraging regular retail investors on TV to short these (MEME) companies and capitalize on the retail investor shorting this time while holding and adding to long positions themselves hence possibly screwing over the retail investor in the opposite direction this time.  Again this is all speculation but there’s a lot of short interest still in these stocks and it’s coming from somebody and we can capitalize on it again. I’ll be honest I really feel like a lot of these hedge funds probably closed ALOT BUT NOT ALL SHORT POSITIONS and covered their short positions when many of these brokerages were preventing people from buying and the price dropped like a rock it only makes sense it was a short window for them and I’m almost 100% sure they capitalized on it who is shorting the stocks right now?... Who knows but somebody is and there are a lot of them and when the stocks go up it’s a very bad time for them.

Don’t care about what you’re doing. But that’s my plan. No financial advice. Hey folks! I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.  Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:  So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101). I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:     TL;DR: You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.    Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic. Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:  you start with ~0~ shares you borrow one from a broker you now have ~1~ shares you sell that share, completing your short you now have ~0~ shares  Now imagine the short squeeze happens. And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc. The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).  Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high: Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital.  You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.  you start with ~0~ shares you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker! you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!  Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with!  Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value:   THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?  Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy. Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.   If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations. Now think about that again.   Effective TL;DR 2.0:  People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule? Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.  But here’s MY question: What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it?  VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.   Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not. Joy to all, ~Unimportant   (this is not financial advise, and I am not a financial advisor) So in essence SYNTHETIC SHORTING by the HEDGE FUNDS provide us with very powerful ROCKET FUEL that will take us not just to the moon but a whole other GALAXY.

Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.

Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.  Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90  &#x200B;  Edit: This is not financial advice I am retarded but I like this stock  Edit: As of 3:15 today the short interest has increased from 38% to 81%"

Daft Punk didn‘t die for PLTR being <$30 I got a shitload of PLTR in both my broker accounts, is that what they mean by diversifying? My account is PLTR, MVIS and FUBO - see you on job seekers How do we feel about PLTR hitting $40 this week Ark Invest dipped once again into Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR), with the fund adding 3,365,400 shares to its portfolio .Looking forward to next week PLTR 🚀🚀 Yo PLTR pls fly so I can quit working at Amazon like a serf for bezos Hoping my PLTR May calls will print enough to recover from this week Idk how much longer I can keep buying the dip on PLTR lol No longer drunk and PLTR still hasn’t mooned C PLTR $40 June 2022; C SNDL $2 1/2023; C KO 1/2023 $55; C WBA $60 1/2023; C PFE 1/2023 $40.

TLDR: PLTR🔜🚀 Before you buy any yolo option out there check the job numbers next friday and their implication on the Stonk market. Any good news Friday will absolutely decimate all the stonks retards love aka PLTR & co ...  PLTR go 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 I'm very bullish on PLTR. HF can short all they want, I believe this stock is amazing and will do well. Hate them all you want, they will be around for awhile. I'm going to have some tendies while it happens. Show PLTR some love you beautiful retards.. please 🙏🏼😂 I'm so loaded up on PLTR. Be nice to see them hit 40 if PLTR goes even for me @30, im definitely selling it for more GME Why PLTR? Am I missing something? Show some love to PLTR next week. Bro can we like save PLTR.   My fucking ass cant take this anymore I legitimately can't decide whether to buy more RKT to hold long or trade. This comment chain is like after 20 GME, 20 PLTR, and 15 AMC comments, you retards need to start looking past memes to see what legit buys (or other legit buys if you aren't ready to move past memes) are on the market right now. Same, everytime I check PLTR in my portfolio am like ""Why can't you just be normal ?"" And face only autistic screams.  PLTR is pain those days I still like the GME stock but it seems to be an orchestrated dead cat bounce to get retail to FOMO in. Take a look at WSB and it clearly worked. It'll probably happen 2-3 more times in the future because people will bet the farm that GME goes up another 100-800% (and they would probably diamond hand for more because infinity gazillion is not a meme). Meanwhile, RKT is straight up free tendies with no downside risk. My prediction is that when RKT lands on the moon, the 7,000,000 new WSB members will FOMO in at the last minute (see Tilray, APHA, GME, AMC, NOK, BB, PLTR, etc...), and be stuck with the bag again. Then they will hate on whatever the next best play is before FOMOing into the top again. PLTR PLTR Cathie Wood isn’t known for throwing good money into a fire pit. If she’s rolling large on it, who am I to second-guess her? I’ve got both PLTR and ARKK, so if both balloon, my wallet does. Serious question, but is the 1.6b shares outstanding and 1b float concerning? PLTR already has a 30b market cap, any significant price movement in the stock would take significant volume and a big market cap bump. Where they are priced now not only seems fair but also seems to have a few years of growth priced in. IBM and ORACLE have multiples higher of revenue and both trade about 3x stock price Meme stock?  Do people know the PLTR founder also cofounded PayPal ?  BUY PLTR I sold. Planning to invest in the company again, i believe they will do well.  My issue is the market instability and bubbles... I'm personally an idiot, and believe April might be a bubble burst.   Once I'm less afraid about everyone being bullish in every damn sector, I'm going in big on PLTR.  If you all get rich while I'm out, I'm cheering you on. Im in 56 @ $29.5ish and even though Ive might have jumped the ship a little too fast, I have full faith in their business.  They have been getting big goverment deals and they are moving more into retail as well. From my understanding they are also gonna help keeping an overview of who have been vaccinated for covid.  It has a high chance of going places and staying at those places because of their sticky model. They become rooted into the bunisesses they have contracts with.  &#x200B;  If GME goes to the moon there is a good chance some of that is being tossed into PLTR. I have a relative who works at PLTR.  You guys know it's a cover for Covert Cyber-ops, right?  Constantly doing work for the CIA, 5 Eyes, CSIS?  Not saying it's a bad investment - it's probably an awesome investment.  They will literally never run out of money.  But just know what you are buying.  Hang on... some dudes in suits with shades are knocking at the door... brb. if you like PLTR, you'll like SFTW. satellite company getting government contracts, backing by Thiel and Chamath, and deals with data like PLTR as well when cathie was getting deep into TSLA i didn't believe her.  when she went deep into PLTR i said F it and bought 1000 shares. picked up another 100 on Friday.  at about $50b the valuation is high, but who knows where this company will be by the end of this year, next year, 2 years. Thats not the one im worried about though. Its just a question of how long it takes things to bounce back up. Also holding PLTR 30 and FCEL 22  for April 16th. Those two making up 90+% of my current poofolio in pain.  If those go worthless, all my gains for the past year are gone. But then I get to post loss porn. :P same boat, I have 45 PLTR 30, 15 PLTR 29, and 50 PLTR 26.5 (bought recently on the dip) for 4/16 and my anoose is bleeding horribly from this week...here's hoping to an upswing from the tax returns and stimmy. Maybe you should buy some PLTR while you’re at it🦍🦍🦍💎👋💎💎💎👋🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀😕 I will tattoo WSB on my ass if PLTR hits $1000 by mid year. 2250 shares and will plow another $20k into it this week. How do people this fucking retarded have so much money for trading.  I'm also long PLTR but shit I don't even seeing it getting 200+ for at least 3 years lol. What a dumbass claim that obviously won't come true. I'll one-up you and tattoo the wsb guy's full body on my taint if PLTR hits Elon's favorite number by EOY. My asshole would make a great lens for his sunglasses. SEC dont deserve a hand shake. and PLTR is killing me The big spikes are my GME shares and one April 200c  Edit: other positions, bunch of ARKF calls that went to shit, 100 PLTR shares at 25 avg. calls on XOM and BP for July. couple other things in the red Shorts, lots of them, apart borrowing shares for shorts I don’t think it’s possible to go above 100%.   GME mutual fund ownership is 3192 %, AMC at 3000% ish, PLTR at 182%, BA at 1700% since everyone expect it to sink after the lost motor.  What is going on right now is absolutely crazy. I’m thinking about getting in RKT and a few others. Bruh do not buy GME with your inheritance check. Buy PLTR, it's at a great price right now. GME gonna burn ya. Invest in PLTR shares ARK bought over 3 million shares of PLTR between 2 etfs today Selling PLTR LEAPs Strategy    The Premiums on calls for PLTR@ 25 expiring 1/20/23, approximately two years from now are currently going for about $12. If you were to sell a covered call, based on the market close price of $23.90, you would have a cost basis of 11.90, and a premium of 12. But what if instead of just selling one CC, you sold 512, and then reinvested the majority of the premium back into more covered calls, and then repeated the process until you couldn't buy a full lot of shares anymore. I did the math on this, link down below, It would require approximately $ 1,223,680.00, to do so. Over the course of it you would come into possession of 102,300 shares, collect $1,227,600 in premium, spent about $400 in commissions, if it's at 0.40 a contract.  Your max gain would be $1,339,720.80, assuming it ends above $25, a return of %109 percent in just under 2 years, with a break-even price at approximately $11.09.  Now obviously selling so many options is going to affect the price, so you'll probably get a good bit less in premium then you would have, but what do you think guys, could this actually work?.  [https: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFw7yYPPTQzOiL4E69-08NUnA8mUhlXvQcCFa-cXvaE/edit?usp=sharing](https: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFw7yYPPTQzOiL4E69-08NUnA8mUhlXvQcCFa-cXvaE/edit?usp=sharing) If PLTR hypothetically took a big shit in this timeframe you could buy back the covered calls on the cheap cheap too and sell the equivalent amount of shares of the premium you didnt end up capturing entirely Ya unless Im missing something, your only risk in this trade that PLTR trades below your new net cost of $11.09 after the calls expire 1/2023.  Below $11.09 your down on your principal, but anything above $11.09 your profitable and the most likely scenario is you get your 100% gain, lose your shares and PLTR is much higher come 2023 TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.  # Premise:  Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https: www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.  But let me try to explain nonetheless.  1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https: www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields. 2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https: www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher. 3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something. 4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https: www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https: www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)    1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.    2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https: www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.       1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on. 5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think). 6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently. 7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.    1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https: www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income. 8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.  # Conclusion  Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:  This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.  Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade, I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.  ^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to retards on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)  Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.  * Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening. * We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon. * Black swan events. * Think of something yourself man! This was a long ass post and I am getting late for finishing my day's work."

HOLD THIS LINE 🙌💎 You're retarded if you think that WSB members are moving the market. The whales are moving and we as small fish are just riding with them.  Anyway, I do believe the squeeze is gonna be big.  # tldr: HOLD Me too! And I just started on Feb 18th. Did great for 2 days. Then last week for pummelled! My head is bloodied but unbowed. I will HOLD till my GMEs are $100K it’s the only way to make up for 2008 destroying my Dad!!! It’s bloody bloody war!! 👩‍🦳🦍💎🦍💎❤️ BUY MORE AND HOLD MF. Too the 🌝 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌🏿 I died when it said  'Trying to figure out how to set a sell order, but I can't cause I've never traded before.  Fuck it, HOLD!!'   hahaha so good 😂😂 Wow together is strong. HOLD THIS TIME WE CANT FAIL!!!!   BUY ~ HOLD ~ REPEAT BUY the DIP, and HOLD. That’s how! Watch out for hedge funds ""Bull Trap"".  Hello friends,I just wanted to start by saying that I believe AMC & GME to both be under value at current prices and covid restrictions as well as NYC AMC opening back up.     NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01. The street sentiment is that AMC's price will be rising on Monday because the number of shares needed to brought to covered call options expired ITM. Fundamentally speaking that's how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn't make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF's decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.  Let just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF's ""Bull Trap"" so DO NOT FALL FOR IT & DO NOT SELL your shares, they will be able to use your shares to increase their short interest attacks and continues their ladder attack as well. We need to decrease the number of shares available in the float NOT increase it, by selling your shares you actually increasing it. It is very important to decrease the number of shares available in the float, that's how you trigger the ""Short Squeeze"". Why would the HF's buy shares from us at $100 if they can just buy it from the float at $10 or $15 to cover their short interest? Would you?  Example:  On January 27th AMC shares jumped 300% from $4.97 to $19.90 in one day. What was the reason behind this movement? AMC raising $900 million in the week before or the CEO announcing bankruptcy is off the table? the answer is none of it, it was the classic HF's bull trap, the hf was losing so much money in GameStop they needed to make money somewhere else, they intentionally put money into AMC to raise the price so retail investors would jump in at $14-$19 thinking the price would continue to go up. We all know what happened next, AMC tanked 65% the following day and people who brought AMC in at $14-$19 were trapped, hint the ""bull trap"".  I don't know what will happen on Monday, none of us do, hopefully, AMC price will rise to $10-$11, but do NOT FALL for the Bull Trap if the price rises to $15 or $20 if you sell your shares kiss goodbye to the short squeeze. Why do you think the HF vs retail investors were battling it out over 1 cent on Friday? Literally, it was down to the last minute. Those 120k+ call options were the catalyst that we needed to pressure the hf to buyback 10 of million of shares to cover their short interest.  ""(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.""  The approval of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine couldn't happen at a better time for AMC shareholders. The last time vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized back on November 7th AMC shoots up to 90% and closed over 50% for the day. All the weeds, airlines, hotels, and housing-related stocks were also up 20%-30% as well.  A new vaccine approved and millions of shares buyback, it will be very interesting how this played out on Monday.  Do NOT Sell my friends. I don’t get why people are so anal about mentioning AMC I own and HOLD both what the fuck is the problem? Hold!!!! HOLD!!!! Togheter we will do this ONLY togheter!! HOLD! WILL YOU JOIN IN OUR CRUSADE  WHO WILL BE STRONG AND HOLD WITH ME  BEYOND $1000  IS THERE A YACHT YOU LONG TO SEE  THEN JOIN IN THE FIGHT  AND GO BUY SOME MORE GME They gave their executives bonuses to protect their shares.. the executives could be selling their shares at these higher share prices... it was an incentive to HOLD!.. Would u rather an executive share sell off? Hes the reason it was going down anyway.  He probably was Shorting AMC himself.  Then they elected to pay him as a slap in the face, because the electing officers was In on the Short too. This is there way of trying to rattle you out of emotion and disappointment.  HOLD EM At a dire moment like this we must remember that it is not he or the company that matters right now. Heck for all I know AMC can just be called Poo, as long as these hedgefunds are shorting it we shall squeeze from them. With that being said they probably meant that he got his bonus in the form of shares BUT, Remember that’s the media. OUR enemy, this is just a random picture of him that’s been manipulated to make us feel as if he’s laughing at our face. This is how the media manipulates. The power is in our hands brothers and sisters and no one else’s. These companies? We like them (assuming you like them) And for that reason WE WILL HOLD. WE WILL SQUEEZE. WE SHALL FEAST ON TENDIES 🚀🚀🚀 I think, Adam investing 3.75 mil + in GME.  So plz HOLD... Been seeing a lot of comments in the past few days, “What’re the chances this is actually going to work?”-esq questions. Look, I’m not going to make you wrong for asking these types of questions because they are rational questions - but WSB wasn’t founded on rationality - it was founded on YOLOing our children’s college funds away and making memes about it. This is a MOONSHOT; not a sure bet - if you can’t handle the fire get out of the kitchen (aka sub to r/investing and get a nice safe index fund).  Here are the facts -> They NEED our shares. We are seeing them BLATANTLY use every trick in the book (naked shorts, keeping prices artificially low, blocking trading, etc) - in fact, they’re not even pretending or hiding it anymore. It’s out in the public - anyone who cares to see it can see it. But here’s the thing: despite all their tricks, at the end of the day - they still NEED our shares. At this point, it is a battle of attrition; they can only keep up their charade for so long before they literally have nothing left to short and they have to buy back their shorted positions (side note: I’m a retard and this prob isn’t exactly how it works but close enough so just fucking go with it for now). By holding (think Articuno chilling in cave [Seafoam Island] status) we lose NOTHING. If people keep buying/selling back and forth, it is playing into their hand. They want us to get bored and sell - behind all their dirty tricks, it sums up to them just trying to get us to sell - either through fear or boredom. Do what you got to do - but I am holding until the bitter fucking end.  Tldr; don’t get fatigue/boredom/fear from this - that’s what they want. Take time away and come back fresh. And most importantly - HOLD  Edit: Include specific location of Articuno’s YOLO spot  Edit 2: change “short ladder attack” to “keep prices artificially low” herp derp Wait wait wait. People sold GME and AMC?!? HOLD!!! So I read WSB MOONDHOT NEED BLATANTLY NEED NOTHING HOLD YOLO  what did you guys see Hang in there and HOLD!! Diamond hands. Diamond balls. $GME. TO. THE. MOON!! Problem with day traders is that they buy and sell each day, which is effectively counterproductive for the squeeze. This is the HF’s latest trick, dont fall for it. The ONLY play is to buy and HOLD! 💎🙌🏼 Here is the thing... at the end of the day, whether the short squeeze happens or not, with what this new board and Ryan Cohen are trying to do this is an extremely undervalued company. Right now sure it “doesn’t have the fundamentals” to back the price but I’m not here for what it’s doing right now I’m invested for where they are trying to take. As a gamer I think I know where they are trying to go and if they do it’s “fair value” will be much much higher than where it is now.   All in all stop worrying about “the squeeze” and if it happens. Its an added bonus.   JUST HOLD!   At least until you hear them announce their plans.   This is not financial advice and I have no idea what I’m talking about. Nah sign your portfolio over to a youngin’ with instructions to HOLD Apes be strong, The Force is with us. There is no compromise, Diamond Hands will Prevail. The End Game is coming and we are HOLDING!!!!! If DFV didn't buy 50,000 @ 38 the stock would've continued to decline. DFV was the catalyst.   But honestly, if the Hedgies push to 50. They're all fucked cause we're in this bitch. AND WE AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.    BUY & HOLD FELLOW RETARDS 💎✊🚀🚀 Lisening to the sound of Camilo "" vida de rico"" and not selling. Great repect for all off you to fight this battle with the heghe funds and I HOLD also tl;dr BUY AND HOLD Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha what he say? Thanks for this free and most valuable useless info! If you’re so concerned where I spend my cash, can you help out with a loan? Ha ha ha ha ha hold.... hold.... hold...  HOLD GME🖕🏼 IM HOLDING BOYZZZZ ILL DECIDE TO SELL ONCE I SEE PRICE GO TO $3000 FUCK THEM. WE MAY HOLD BAGS BUT THEY ARE FULL OF DIAMONDS Uh, you follow through and HOLD! Which one of you smooth brains wrote this dumpster fire of an article? LOL I had a dream where it reached 13 thousand. HOLD!!!!!!! Ummm. Either Buy GME!!!  Or Fukn HOLD!!!  I think that is what he meant 🎯🚀🚀🚀 All I heard was blah blah blah buy more and HOLD Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date! It is always nice to read some quality DD. But finally after we know that HF is minimum 200%, likely 800% shorted, each DD that you read from now, might help you to be motivated, but it is not necessary any more .  The only DD that you need from now is the trust level in all the other apes.  1. How long will all the lovely retard apes worldwide hold?   2. How long will they be patiently wait for the squeeze?  3.Until which price the majority will hold when we see the squeeze?  These are the only three questions which matter. Nobody will be able to answer these questions for you.   I believe in all the lovely apes.  I will HOLD!  I will BUY more! I continue to HOLD because I like the stock"

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)  \----------  Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https: www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https: www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https: www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.  \----------  For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:  ""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xw8lu1l122k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=644af631e8387d60cb475e33e67fcd1c66018b8d #LETS MAKE THIS THE MOST AWARDED AND UPVOTED REDDIT POST EVER BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon.  HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK. Was up $30K+ at one point. 🥜 I LIKE THE STOCK Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
AY,45,56148," BULLISH TECH BULL MARKET UNTIL 2028  STAY IN THE MARKET AND GET RICH BOYS! the weekend goes by WAY faster when your banging hookers and lines of coke Everybody at work: YAY THE WEEKEND IS HERE!!!  WSB: ""Hello Darkness my old friend."" This gamma squeeze will cause the short cover which will result in the MOTHER OF ALL SQUEEZES  THERE MAY NEVER BE ANOTHER SQUEEZE LIKE GME EVER GUYS STFU AND STOP HATING ON THE MAN. ITS HIS MONEY, AND CHOICE. GOOD LUCK MY GUY! ONCE THE STOCK STARTS GOING UP HE WILL START MAKING MONEY. IT DOESN’T HAVE TO HIT $800. MAY IT GO TO $1000. GOOD LUCK! I can’t wait for MOONDAY LETS GET SOME TENDIES APES 🚀🚀🚀🚀 The conditions have changed.     Originally the short positions were ALL under water. As the stock rose, say from $4 - $40, 140% of the float was short. If you were, for instance, 1,000,000 shares short at $4... You now were $40,000,000 upside down.      The HEAVY options activity back in January meant that call writers needed to hedge their risk as the price rose. There was one day it went from $20-$30 (50%) and then $30-$40. As that happened the likihood of those options expiring in the money became more realistic and the call writers needed to go get the shares in the case they had to deliver them to option owners. It literally was a BOMB waiting to explode.      Add in the WSB retail interest, the low float, and you had a catalyst for the stock to ONLY GO UP. Literally. An amazing historical moment in the history of finance.      After the wednesday when the price spiked from $60-$120 we saw a lot of profit taking and a lot of shorting at $120. This crashed the price to $60. This is the first moment that some new shorts entered at $120. Those positions were now healthy at $60.     Despite this, most shorts and most of the shorted float was still REALLY underwater big time. The big shorters were being margin called. As they were margin called they began selling blue-chips and their main holdings to get liquidity, this is why the market dipped big, and some shorters were margin called and liquidated- forced to close their positions.      So then the price went north of $120, now ALL shorters are under water again, and likely some started buying call options to hedge if this thing went up more. This actually exasperated the problem and made it more likely to go up due to call writers hedging.      So add in: 140% short float, margin calls, volatile stock, a lot of call options ITM, retail interest and WSB hype, PLUS big hedge funds were now entering the fun to make money on the squeeze.      POP... Price goes parabolic. Thursday night many shorts were looking at multi-billion dollar losses that they could not pay. The brokers would have had to pay those. So the brokers all decide to stop letting GME be bought. The shorters go to work Friday and sell, sell, sell... They drive the price down to $200 while opening new shorts at $450. Now a lot of shorts are in the green, but they haven't necessarily closed.   &#x200B;  Over the course of the next week people become despondent, fearful, and many sell. This gives shorts that opened at $450 downwards lots of liquidity to close shorts if they want, banking a killing. Those original shorts under $40 MAY have been closed as they were to average out with their other plays that worked. All in all most shorts are now hedged with long and short plays so nothing in particular can kill them. They are no longer cornered.      Since then the price has went UP and DOWN a lot. Every time it goes up it's a new opportunity for new short positions and new long positions. Every time it goes down it's an opportunity for shorts to close and bank profit and new longs to go in. The positions of every player now mean no one is overly compromised or stuck, there are just a lot of players involved with different profit targets. This means we shouldn't see any big margin calls or any forced covering of shares. These guys can wait it out, or they are hedging with their long calls if the price goes crazy stupid up. They are not idiots despite getting in this situation.      So while the GME price might be volatile and it might even get back to $500 the underlying infinite squeeze is no longer possible.      The only real way that the average retail guy can make money now is by being smart with your price entry and your price exit. Have a price target. Do you want to make 10%, 20%, 50%? Have that in mind and start taking profits once you are ahead. All that capital you will make you can use on your next trade.      Good luck to everyone, but do not buy into this situation as the conditions being the same as before- they are SO different... iS ThIs yOuR FIrsT dAY hEre?

(500shares), bought from 30 to 325. Was up 150k (which would've be life changing)and heald until I paper handed for 111 when it really dropped. Contemplated my life choices and started reinvesting. Don't know why but I can't watch from the sidelines bought back in at 160 last week and averaged down to 125 by Friday with 150 shares. Got another 1k to fight with in monday and planning to get out of some positions for more ammo....I can wait to feast on moon berries with you fellow retards... 🚀 🚀 🌝 SNDL IS THE WAY THEY HAVE ZERO DEBT & OVER $610M IN UNRESTRICTED CASH FROM RECENT CAPITAL RAISES READY TO SEE THIS TAKE OFF BACK & BEYOND $13 A SHARE  💸💰🤑🚀🤘👩‍🚀💎👐🌜🌎💯 ZOM IS THE WAY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Hey folks! I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.  Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:  So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101). I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:     TL;DR: You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.    Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic. Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:  you start with ~0~ shares you borrow one from a broker you now have ~1~ shares you sell that share, completing your short you now have ~0~ shares  Now imagine the short squeeze happens. And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc. The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).  Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high: Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital.  You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.  you start with ~0~ shares you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker! you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!  Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with!  Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value:   THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?  Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy. Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.   If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations. Now think about that again.   Effective TL;DR 2.0:  People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule? Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.  But here’s MY question: What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it?  VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.   Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not. Joy to all, ~Unimportant   (this is not financial advise, and I am not a financial advisor) Lmaooooooooooo! I FEEEL YOU!!  THEY GOT TO PAY TOO PLAY!!! ALL ABOARD THE RKT SHIP. 1 WAY TICKET YOU DIRTY FUCKING APES  I heard the SHORTS CAN'T BORROW YOUR SHARES TO SHORT IF YOU DO THE FOLLOWING. 1.

I seriously wonder if I should make a post to clear up the air on this because people are WAY overthinking this causing very foolish and brash bets that seem ludicrous to me. I agree with you on the mini squeeze, but I think Wednesday we may see a big jump and then a plummet by Friday. This isn’t anything new though. GME was being manipulated this way long before DFV jumped in. It’s honestly a cow that theoretically can produce infinite milk and will continue to be shorted until the gamma squeeze happens. I had to scroll WAY too far for this Jesus thank you. I don't know how people keep spreading this bullshit that an expired ITM would not be executed- they are all executed! Even if a retail trader doesn't sell, they don't get a choice- their broker is going to execute it. If they have the cash to cover, it's going to be used, and if they don't their broker is going to give the shares to them on margin. **(THIS SHOULD SAY AMC/GME)**                                                                                                                                             ""When the WSB community hoards GameStop shares on margin accounts, Robinhood holds a large amount of shares at its account with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC, the organisation responsible for clearing equity markets).

With high demand for shares to lent and a low float of shares, Robinhood make premium bucks renting the shares “bought” by the WSB community to those hedge funds and other agents wanting to short GameStop.  Further, Robinhood clients have accepted that Robinhood keeps all the proceeds from lending shares. Many other brokers (mainly the prime brokers) share the proceeds from lending with the client.

Thats just science. &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xya25adl12k61.png?width=2801&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd38d15d50baf3f67144c20916bbffc469632009  Hello again my fellow apes🦍!  BOILERPLATE: I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀  WARNING: BY THE END OF THIS POST YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS EUPHORIA OR PREMATURE 🚀 SYNDROME. THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF 'CONFIRMATION BIAS'. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE.  [Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)  \----------  Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https: www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https: www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https: www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.  \----------  For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:  ""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xw8lu1l122k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=644af631e8387d60cb475e33e67fcd1c66018b8d I don't think it's a rule with such low deltas hahaha you're pretty much THETA FUCKED ALL DAY EVERYDAY hahaha but enjoy premium access to this board lol. You'll be admitted with A+ status. 💎🙌🦍here. I wrote some basic advice I'll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action, or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper-handing. Paper-handing is fundamentally bad investment practice, especially if you're a new investor. I'll explain why.  *DISLAIMER: I've only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff, and he hasn’t steered me wrong yet. So take it for what it’s worth... But based on all the fact that paper-handing is even an issue here, you apes clearly need this advice.* ***EDIT: These are ""fundamentals"" to the way I trade, but obviously everyone's trading strategy is different. Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing, which doesn't encourage YOLO-ing. This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to ""outsmart"" the general public by spotting opportunities/value before the market does. I feel it's particularly relevant to the GME play. The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it. There are other approaches (which often require more experience) but I feel this is most accessible to new investors. GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything. Well, everything that you don’t think will go bankrupt or get delisted.***  **New traders, or people who are thinking of becoming new traders, should read this.** Especially if you're new, I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market. This applies to all stock, not just GME. If you're experienced, it might just sound like I'm explaining at length why 2 + 2 = 4, but since a friend of a friend told me he paper-handed on GME (sold the dip), I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea.  **I would encourage people to buy GME, but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while.** (edit: in addition, just to reiterate, keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down) By this I mean **NEVER SELL AT A LOSS**. Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down. All newbie investors (IMO) should adhere to this rule just in general. Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground, or don’t buy it at all.  Many investors, myself included, follow this rule religiously, not just with GME but with all stocks. I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss, I just held or bought more. COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out? I just held and was fine... should have bought more. If everyone bought into GME with this mindset, I bet it would go to Pluto easily.  If you sell at a loss, you are donating to the ""save the short sellers"" fund out of your own wallet, fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes, and you’re not even following sound investment practice. Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy. If you’re thinking of investing so much that you’ll wuss out, poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red... just don’t. Emotion and the stock market do not mix well.  Stop losses (below purchase price) are also for pansies and genuine idiots. “I’ll sell you some stock... but only if you give me a bad enough price on it.” Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down... if you feel like you need a stop loss, you're investing more than you should. Instead of being stupid, maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips.  Side note: personally, in the case of GME, I don’t have any limit sells either. From what I can tell on past short squeezes, the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down. So as long as you keep an eye on GME when it actually does skyrocket, you should have plenty of time. Set price alerts and relax. No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid-launch.  Although, if you want you can try to profit off GME volatility. Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I'm not sure they deserve it. As far as I know, buying low and selling high doesn’t really help HFs, it drives the price up (just not as much as buying and holding). But personally, my philosophy is, I can take baby profits anytime... who knows when something like this GME rise will happen again. So I’m holding (101 shares at cost average $106/share).  Want to get into the game now? You could always just buy a few shares, and keep the rest of what you’re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip. And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more, bringing your cost average down. Ideally, you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero. Always try to keep cash in reserve.  Locked yourself in at a high price? That's why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down. Didn't keep any cash in reserve? Guess you're stuck waiting for one of three things: 1) the short squeeze which will likely (though not certainly) happen, 2) for the price of GME to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases, or 3) you get your hands on some more cash you're willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down. **DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS** and you will never lose (edit: well, seldom, if ever. Unless the company goes bankrupt, a rare occurrence. This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket, and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero, it won't swallow your portfolio. Also, if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something, you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson). Hedge funds and billionaires know this, that's why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic. They bought the dip while regular folks paper-handed and got even poorer.  One more little trick. If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares, then even if your position goes “underwater,” you can always sell calls at above your average cost, bring DOWN your cost basis, and make money off your stock “risk free” while still following the rule of never sell at a loss. Although if you did it right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze. Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen, and you'll need to be patient and, like I said before, say goodbye to your money for a while.  **EDIT:** Just to reiterate, there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies. Trade however you want, just don’t paper hand GME. I would also note that you *can* sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule, if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price. It still follows the rule of ""don't sell at a loss."" Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100, doesn't matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier. You can even (slowly) take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5%, and sell one when it goes up 5%.  **EDIT:** Yes I know about opportunity cost. It does apply if you know something the general public doesn’t (rare if you’re just a low IQ ape but GME was/is an exception). Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn't, it could be a coin flip whether you'll hit rock bottom. In an ideal world, you can keep some money in reserve so you don’t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities. Yes I know about (and agree with) the sunk cost fallacy. My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal, lowering the cost basis, not “doubling down” on sunk cost.  Tl;dr 🦍buy 🍌, don’t give 🐍 🍌 unless 🐍 give more than 🦍pay for 🍌  Not financial advice. I am literally a zoo ape that somebody dropped their phone into the enclosure of. BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon.  HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK. Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date! Bigger. WAY bigger!! GME HIGH OF $403 TODAY ACCORDING TO NASDAQ THIS IS THE WAY 💎✊🚀 I'm just a retard who likes drawing with crayons.  Today's AH was pretty flat compared to the last 4 days (mostly due to no one changing their positions before a weekend).  I might be WAY off, but this is what I drew.  I see 3 scenarios Monday:  1. We open and smashed through the upper yellow line on our way to infinity and beyond 2. We bounce and hit mid 70's, break down and get rekt. 3. We bounce and hit mid 70's, bounce again and retry mid to low 90s (then I'd have to draw more pretty lines)  &#x200B;  TLDR: Creyon ape draws pretty picture.  https: preview.redd.it/31kxqmdg5yj61.png?width=1467&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2a704072307055449c4967f9da615048439d8e7 Courtesy of u/brawnerboy  I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https: www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)  If you haven't already, you should read it.  Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.  Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90  &#x200B;  Edit: This is not financial advice I am retarded but I like this stock  Edit: As of 3:15 today the short interest has increased from 38% to 81% Hedge fund shills are spreading disinformation saying $800 is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.  It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.  DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN.  It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. IMAGINE IF YOU HAD SOLD EARLIER THIS WEEK AT $40!  WE CAN STAY RETARDED, LONGER THAN YOU CAN STAY SOLVENT!!"
WWE,35,6068," Damn this was WWE in its prime This meme would work, but for you who know WWE lore, the guy who gets ass-to-mouth resuscitation actually owns the situation around him. He chose to let that happen. Guess he’s into big, mostly naked men... public humiliation... and owns WWE... I guess that checks out.  P.s. loving that chick at the end with the pink tights Still can't believe homophobes would get defensive and angry when I said WWE was kinda gay Instructions unclear: bought calls on WWE I can’t imagine working for WWE and knowing you’re about to get a face full of Rikish’s ass. I always associated WWE with the weird kids in school and this video doesn't help shape that image any differently Friend: *says WWE isn't real*  Me: *shows this clip* I never realized the WWE went full Dragonball This was when I watched WWE heavy, too. Ah, the good old days. I have no idea what's going on now. dude, I need to watch WWE. This is amazing ""WWE is fake"" bro how do you fake Vince Mcmahon eating ass LIVE Every day I think to my myself should I buy WWE shares just off nostalgia I’ll never understand WWE, but gimme that GME anyway Lol I remember this. When it was changed to WWE it was never the same Damn WWE was pretty gay When you refer to it as WWE in its prime.... 😂😂😂   WWF was its prime!!! How the hell can anyone above 5 watch WWE? Isn’t the hedge fund in the gif the dude that owns WWE?  “I got an idea, ram my face into that buff dudes ass. It’s gonna be epic television” Doesn't Vince own WWE? Like, he had to totally be down for this to happen. No one made him, unless he was blackmailed or something. I stopped watching after Lita left. She was the only female WWE wrestler in history to shock the world of wrestling with her luchador moves. Her and edge’s one segment had the highest views in the history of wrestling. She broke her neck on multiple occasions doing backflips off of the ropes and the hurricarana. Her and the hardy boys were amazing to watch. My favorites! I can’t see anyone duplicating her. I sad WWE is gay and people were all mad. Honestly this is pretty similar to Billy Herrington wrestling of course this is only a close second to Billy's works. WWE kinky as fuck How is WWE not the ultimate meme stock? All the memes from WWE are from back in the day. WWE is how republicans have become so retarded too, unfortunately The rock shoved his face in. It was to keep the Rock in the WWE. Those are the terms. I'm thankful every day I grew up during the prime. WWE was fucking epic to 10 year old me Your making me feel old with that....when I was young it was actually WWF But they changed their name around 1996 roughly to WWE. Vince McMahon, owner of WWE started a ""kiss my ass club"" where he used to force people to literally kiss his ass ( he did that to JR too ($450 guy at the end)). Then sometimes later The Rock forced him to kiss Rikhishi' ass.  You can watch the whole segment on YouTube. It's gold. One thing I know of recently is the WWE was or is trying to take revenue from anyone's Twitch/TikTok account saying they're contactors for the league using their IP or whatever. Andrew Yang called out Vince for this too. Same! Loved WWF and then they started calling it WWE. This is why I just bought WWE stock last week on their current dip >The announcer was forced to kiss vince's ass in an earlier part of the story line iirc    Well, everyone had a ""role"".. and they all nailed it  >  WWF/WWE always been like a great movie or TV Show   Everyone had/has a script, and the rest depends on the male and female ""wrestlers/performers"" and their acting skills.  Most of them are all high level athletes IRL too   >  But Selling a story to the millions watching, and generating massive hype.. takes talent.    WWF and early 2000s WWE was the golden age. It lost some of the best people, and became more PG13 later on.. Then it just lost that enigma which made WWE a Multi-Billion dollar entertainment corporation with an enormous fan base world wide.   >  There was a time, when almost every young folk all around the world stayed glued to the TV on Monday and Friday nights.. religiously Ali doesn't trade GME at all, and hasn't.

PY,29,461," Broke up with my girlfriend on my birthday.  She was acting wild and got pissed.  Let’s focus on the important things.  SPY 400 soon. Feeling cute, might fuck around and pour my life's savings into 0dte SPY puts tomorrow, idk Biden wants to reduce wealth inequality, then have new stimulus be paid in SPY calls instead Traders on Twitter be like “this market is overindulged and ready for a big correction”   Followers: “So we’re going down next week?”   Trader: “No idiot, SPY $400 first, correction later — idk when ... but it’s coming and I will remind you when it happens that I called it”  🤡🤡🤡 buying MARA RIOT after bitchcoin falls to 38k, FUBO after earnings pump & dump & SPY call debit spreads exp MARCH 19th is the play for two weeks? Right after when SPY tops, buying VIX calls exp April maybe 🤔 Caesar was once kidnapped by pirates who asked for a 20 gold coin ransom. He laughed and said “do you know who I am? I’ll give you 50.” While he waited he read the pirates his poetry and made them stop talking when he went to sleep. After his ships returned and paid the ransom, he then hunted the pirates down, had their throats slit and crucified them.  Position: SPY 400C April 1st My friend says I'm financially irresponsible because I YOLOed 40% of my net worth on 1dte SPY puts, even though I made 30% on it  Told him to fuck off til I lose I just want to return back to 2 weeks ago when SPY closed the week at $394 and QQQ at $335, we were preparing for a 3 day weekend, every indicator pointed to $400 within a week or so, everyone was bullish and there was no fear in the market... Got $379 and $381 SPY calls for $5 each on Friday, they expire Monday. Plz At this point the forbidden ticker is just a 6x leveraged SPY inverse. Anybody got SPY FD Calls in this last 2 days? If yes, how's your asshole feeling? I have been shitting blood since Friday. I have SPY puts. I’ll be ok lol PUFFCO AND HAPPY CABBAGE DABS Buy the dips. And getting VIX/VXX calls and SPY puts. The puts on March 19 is insane. Look at SPY $350. And then look at any date before/after. It's a special situation this time around.  Everyone is in this one together.  If it were weekly SPY $400 calls, I'd be celebrating the retard too. I just did a quick Excel calculation using up my crayon stash for the energy and some Wikipedia data on Magellan's performance since '84 ([https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity\_Magellan\_Fund](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_Magellan_Fund)) and as of 2020 the fund returned a whopping 7% above SPY during this time. Get in before the moon bois, it's launching any time now! SPY puts. Aaaaaand it's gone #GUH  Haven't you learned? Never buy SPY puts.  JPOW will personally come to rape your wife's boyfriend Wtf how do u afford that?? SPY puts are expensive Yeahhhhh I bought 3/19 SPY puts to hedge AAPL calls and of course they continued to move opposite directions. I sold to close the position at a loss when SPY touched 378 Friday. Cheap & deep OTM SPY puts are Black Swan insurance. In March last year, they paid off big for some people. Do you realize just how much SPY needs to tank to reach $279 though? I don't think you purchased that fully understanding the risk and probability. [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.

(Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.

That's about to change drastically. This morning, Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42.3%, said they repurchased $24.7 billion in shares in 2020, and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year ([2](https: www.berkshirehathaway.com/2020ar/linksannual20.html)). In addition, Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter. However, more important than any of these things (as significant as they are) is what was missing from the letter this year.  As many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years. He's complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term. In the meantime, he's fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines, banks, japanese conglomerates, etc. With this backdrop, remember that Buffett is not a boomer, he's from the Silent Generation. So, what he didn't say in the report is really important.   So what the fuck didn't he say? He didn't complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn't warn that BRK might lag SPY. You're not grasping the significance yet. Let me explain.  The reason he's been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants. In fact, he explains in his letter linked above that they're even better. He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them. Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner.  Over the next year, the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter. There's no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine.  Also, here's some simple math for you. SP500 P/E ratio: 38.8. BRK P/E ratio: 13.5. [Yes, I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK's P/E. That's because BRK's portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income.] This means BRK's underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion!  This is why Buffett didn't warn that BRK might underperform. He's back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY's ass again. Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK's multiple again.  Calls were cheap on Friday so I bought 170 BRK.B $242.50C 3/5/21. $50K YOLO on the Oracle of Omaha. technically SPY did not go into correction territory but nasdaq did. By the technical definition That's what I said. It was just a dip. But SPY technically, is signaling a correction. [https: imgur.com/a/hbY3A1X](https: imgur.com/a/hbY3A1X)"
WH,28,18527," Monday? MONDAY??! WHERE ARE YOU!? Squeeze or gamma squeeze? This stock has squeezed so many times this month already. It’s a cow that produces infinite milk. Look at last week. Look at the chart.  WHY is it still being squeezed is the question you should ask yourself. My question to you is: are you profiting off the squeeze like I am or speculating about to jump in still?   I’m not telling you to buy the stock. I’m just explaining very loosely how I profited and will continue to do so without selling shares :) DAD.... WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE??? There are a WHOPPING 30,000 contracts expiring Friday for an $800 strike. Currently selling for $2.14  These are strikes expiring in one week with the strike price that is 800% out of the money now.  Incredible!   The fact people are getting $2 premiums for this. Wow. I remember buying some shares because I saw some moves like this last squeeze. Then I lost thousands of dollars trusting people with money to know the market better than me. WHOOPS. He bought calls, he can't lose more than he already paid for them, which was around $25,000.  That money is already in the hands of whoever sold the calls.  RH won't let them expire in the money if you don't have the cash to exercise, so they will close them out on the expiration day for him, and he'll get a handsome premium if they're ITM at that time.  If they expire worthless (okay, WHEN), this idiot gets nothing and owes nothing more. Can someone explain to me WHY the squeeze will last days/weeks?

[Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.

These mothafuckers shorted more shares than we bought???   YALL KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE TAX RETURNS ON MONDAY  Not my cat advise. I'm not a stock. I love the moon BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon.  HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK. Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
WIL,27,14158," SEC WILL BE ALL OVER THIS!

By Sumer time AMC WILL BE $850 no bs Thats up for you to decide < I believe it's a similar company & that unless a new pandemic keeps them closed down another season or more, that A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL GO TO SEE NEW MOVIES.  I believe it will be worth 5x in 2 years time, If a short squeeze happens then thats just a bonus for us all!!!  I say buy and hold both if you can... The big companies say we’re out of our mind. That we don’t know what we’re doing that we’re small tule investors, that we’re going to lose all our money that this will go nowhere.  That GME isn’t something that will take us into retirement or success in the long run. I say FUCK EM! I say it’s time us the “little people” show the “big people” that we can control our own futures, that we indeed know what we’re doing and that we indeed believe in our cause and that we are not going to give in and give them what we want, we don’t care how much money they have or how much power they have, UNITED WE WILL SUCCEED, UNITED WE WILL COME OUT ON TOP, UNITED WE WILL MAKE HISTORY!

We like crayons, tendies, our wife’s new boyfriend and most of all we like GameStop. THEY WILL SING BALLADS ABOUT THE RETARDISM SHOWN HERE TODAY! At a dire moment like this we must remember that it is not he or the company that matters right now. Heck for all I know AMC can just be called Poo, as long as these hedgefunds are shorting it we shall squeeze from them. With that being said they probably meant that he got his bonus in the form of shares BUT, Remember that’s the media. OUR enemy, this is just a random picture of him that’s been manipulated to make us feel as if he’s laughing at our face. This is how the media manipulates. The power is in our hands brothers and sisters and no one else’s. These companies? We like them (assuming you like them) And for that reason WE WILL HOLD. WE WILL SQUEEZE. WE SHALL FEAST ON TENDIES 🚀🚀🚀 The big companies say we’re out of our mind. That we don’t know what we’re doing that we’re small tule investors, that we’re going to lose all our money that this will go nowhere.  That GME isn’t something that will take us into retirement or success in the long run. I say FUCK EM! I say it’s time us the “little people” show the “big people” that we can control our own futures, that we indeed know what we’re doing and that we indeed believe in our cause and that we are not going to give in and give them what we want, we don’t care how much money they have or how much power they have, UNITED WE WILL SUCCEED, UNITED WE WILL COME OUT ON TOP, UNITED WE WILL MAKE HISTORY! LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE APES OF THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH ONCE UPON A TIME BOARDED A ROCKETSHIP AND FUCKING BLEW IT INTO MOTHERFUCKING SPACE AND LANDED ON PLUTO AND STUCK A $GME FLAG INTO THE GROUND OF SAID PLANET! Im just saying: I WILL COMPLETELY SHORT THE STOCK WITH MY WHOLE AVAILABLE MONEY. Don’t care about what you’re doing. But that’s my plan. No financial advice. The big companies say we’re out of our mind. That we don’t know what we’re doing that we’re small tule investors, that we’re going to lose all our money that this will go nowhere.  That GME isn’t something that will take us into retirement or success in the long run. I say FUCK EM!

Shorts have been suppressing the price for months, genius move on the part of RKT management to smash them with the $1.10 divi.   New money will come in leading up to March 9th, finally breaking us out of this resistance at $24.  Shorts will also have to pay divi out of pocket (fuck em) AND a squeeze should be triggered as they scramble to cover. HOW HIGH WILL IT GO!? Lol give it a couple years and Cathie Wood WILL be known for throwing good money into a fire pit !! ARRRRRR MOTHER FUCKERS!!! ALL ABORD THE APES SHIP!!! WE GOT A TREASURE ISLAND TO TAKE!!!!! THE JOURNEY TAKES US DEEP TO THE FUCKING BOTTOM BUT DAVID JONES WILL NOT CATCH US. WIND AND OCEAN FAVORED US!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Not sure how you arrived at that conclusion. I only stated that Biden has ""just"" taken office. There is no way his team will let the market go belly up and have GME define his presidency. It won't happen. It's not about WHO the current president is but rather the overall climate of the country. Please enlighten me on what the worst situation is? What $200, $300 a share? You're out of your mind if you think this is going to sub $50 anytime soon.  Ape's WILL GET PAID AND LAND ON MOON.. Chicago and The Street will probably get bailed out and the wheels keep on turning. Fuck off. This is my money. I call the shots. RH sucks though. I have fidelity as well. BUT I WILL NOT PUT MY ORIGINAL INVESTMENT IN LIMBO. [7 stages of Grief](https: preview.redd.it/6coyfa02e2k61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=94aa10132da415cda2bf76a0c61db63f45db65ee)  **Shock:** they couldn't believe GME got so much support  **Denial:** they said that they closed their positions and have no stake in GME anymore  **Anger:** they continue to short GME into the ground and also all other ETFs that contain GME  **Bargaining:** THIS IS THE STAGE WE ARE IN THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE YOU SELL AT LOW BALL NUMBERS. 10K, 20K, 50K, 90K!!! **100K BEING THE FLOOR IS NOT A MEME**  PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT SHILLS ARE INFESTING THIS SUBREDDIT TO LOWER YOUR PERSONAL PRICE. THERE WILL **NEVER** BE ANOTHER ""NAME YOUR PRICE"" DEAL IN HISTORY  *not financial advice but I am not taking out my initial investment and not selling until we surpass 100K because it is not a meme* BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS.""

So far it’s always been after the stimmies drop. Look at January and May of last year. Heck, look at TSLA! You should get in before the stimmies drop though. Buy options and take profits to buy shares to support the cause :) While I read through this thread my brain somehow replaced GME with TSLA and I was thinking “$800 is totally doable”. But then my eyes did a double take. That’s the beauty of this though right? For the fact that the IV is so fucking insane that even at $800 a share, we have to think if that’s even a safe bet - lol there is no safe bets here. I hope OP hits it because if he hits it then a lot of us 💎🙌 are getting TSLAs for our 2nd grade teachers She predicted TSLA's 4000 stock price before its 1st split tho Everyone should understand that markets are pulling back because of margin calls not fricken interest rates. I’m buying call options on $RTX $RKT $BB $BA $TSLA $AMZN $BABA $JD $PYPL. Trillions are sitting on sidelines and are about to be put to work. I believe we are about to witness a huge bull run. Don’t even get me started on Home prices hitting higher highs. My hedge are $SPXU and $VXX calls as well. Gl on making the $3 mil back but I’m positive you’ll be back on top before eoy. When I get vaccinated I’ll be back playing baccarat as well. 🍻 For instance, I used to sell put options on TSLA.  So then TSLA goes up $200, I make a ton of money, *and* I get a margin call.  Why?  The broker is now calculating that the standard deviation of the stock price is $200.  TSLA goes from $400 to $600, and my broker suddenly thinks that the chance of going to $200 has *increased*.  This is dumb, and brokers are dumb.  But what can you do... Actually, my lay answer is pretty correct, modulo the part where I say the standard deviation is now $200.  That was a simplification.  If you want to be more precise, the Black-Scholes model is derived from stochastic calculus where the underlying processes are driven by a geometric Brownian motion.  In this setting, the logarithmic volatility is indeed unbiased (""not directional"").  And this modeling assumption is often valid, but not in the case.  The true options market reflected that (corresponding put contracts still decreased heftily in value).  The mistake (for E\*trade) here is in calculating the greeks from a single strike price.  In this case, the profile of the entire suite of options (both calls and puts) reflected the asymmetric risk.  No rational entity thought that when TSLA increased from $400 to $600, it became *more likely* to go to $200 in the next month than it was at $400 (or any other part of the tail). When I touched AMC stock I smelled it and bought TSLA instead. You sure about that?  He also pushed through a stock offering despite the SEC grumbling about it, wiping *$600 million* of debt off the books. That's a good move.  And stop with this ""WE"" shit. There is no we, and if you use your crayons to scribble some numbers you'll realize that the combined might of WSB is absolute peanuts compared to pretty much any of the big players.  WSB influences sentiment, but we don't have hundreds of billions in capital to chuck around. I read elsewhere on here that the main reason $TSLA is so high is because of WSB. Fuckin LOL. Come on guys, back to reality here. TSLA to $1000+ confirmed I have hypothesized this same thing. The observable correlation between the rise in GME and AMC stock and the decline of other stocks like TSLA was uncanny.   There is this old adage that, ""the stock market is a reflection of rich people's feelings.""  My supposition as to why HFs are willing to sell off all assets may be as simple as the pay off for successfully shorting out GME would be massive. Perhaps enough for them to breaking even, or stave off financial ruin.   If the stock market is a reflection of rich people's feelings, they are pissed. But furthermore, I see a now that there are also a zhit ton of apes that far outnumber the elite. We like the stock.   Your theory is much more developed than mine, for I am just a chimp that had been given a 🔫. No one should take anything I wroteded here as financial advice. This post is providing me with confirmation bias. Why TSLA? EV market saturated, GM has full line ready, Lordstown, Rivian, etc compete for investment dollars and have more upside. I sold my TSLA, feel like it's done. Viewing TSLA as an EV company, I think, is wrong. Have you ever been in a TSLA? Seen it drive itself?   The cars are in a different league than all the other EVs who are still touting backup cameras, lane assist, and at best, self parallel park.  Elon’s got some master plan in his head and now he’s got the money to make it happen. TSLA is an energy company, not just a car company. I’m banking on them blowing their competitors out of the water in the EV market, but I am even more excited by the future of their energy solutions like power walls and solar roofs. Capital gains don’t count. The CRA only checks to see if you exceed your annual contribution limit. I have heard of TSLA TFSA millionaires getting fucked by the CRA and taxed because of the vague TFSA trading rules. But honestly if GME moons then A tax is the last thing I’ll be thinking about when cathie was getting deep into TSLA i didn't believe her.  when she went deep into PLTR i said F it and bought 1000 shares. picked up another 100 on Friday.  at about $50b the valuation is high, but who knows where this company will be by the end of this year, next year, 2 years. Because that's how it always happens. They write many contracts and adjust their risk position as the stock changes.     BUT when it appreciates in ways that no one expected, so as the share price rises and becomes more likely that certain written calls are ITM, then these market makers will rush out to buy the stock so if they end up ITM they can cover. This is really why you can see the gamma squeeze.     In the case of GME it all comes back to the float. Because there are so few actual shares going around when it becomes time for them to go to market to get the shares they might have a lot of trouble locating any- driving the price up big time. This is the theory... Larger floats like AMC won't have a share shortage but you may still see a good old squeeze or a bit of a gamma BUT shorters don't have to cover unless they're margin called- and that doesn't really happen, they can just get more money or sell down long positions. So.... The only real squeeze is a long-term one, when the company actually is doing better and not likely to go bankrupt. TSLA great example. People shorted that for years. Most retails have no patience. > metric  These use realistic valuations though.  The only way it is getting even close to that high (non-squeeze) is if options settle down and people starting buying them consistently like they did with TSLA.  But there isn't the same widespread excitement for a videogame company as their is for an ev and renewable energy company.  P/E and market cap don't matter as much in a bubble.  And we're in a hype fueld bubble.  So I do think it could very well go up from here.  But it also could dip down first...   Either way 2k non-squeeze price is outrageously optimistic unless new news happens that revolutionizes their storefront (that hasn't already been shared).   Plus they have 100M worth of shares to launch that will dilute the share price at some point.  There will be more shares floated well before any discussion of splits happens, to clear up their debt.  So maybe a lot more shares if the stock price does rise gently long term.  Plus dividends reinstituted possibly.  I'm typing all this because you're selling less knowledgeable people unrealistic dreams that you know are just that.    Otherwise why stop at 2k?  why not 10k?  50k? 100k?  1 million per share?   let's dream big if you're going to dream. [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates Correct. Typically short positions should benefit from a broader market sell-off, however in the case of GME which happened to be over-shorted, the dynamics changed... making it a risky play susceptible to other shorts covering to free up cash, which would cause a chain effect pushing prices higher against all the short participants in the stock.   \---   Generally Hedge Funds pride themselves on being ""hedged"" with short bets that make money on market slides, even if their long bets are losing money. But in this situation of being over-shorted, GME was no longer a good hedge against market sell-offs.  \---  We might get to a point where most hedge funds abandon shorting GME, and the short interest drops back down to around 5% only, which is much less than today. This could happen despite the price of GME being much higher than it is today, similar to what happened with TSLA. >Okay, so de-margin my Tesla, put it all into GME, wait for SQUOZE, cash out, put back into TSLA at bottom? TSLA 🚀 Alright, I know most of you can't read anything longer than a fortune cookie, so I'm putting this right up here at the top:  TL;DR -    1. GME market cap goes up   2. Index funds end up underweight GME   3. They must fix this before May/June, or losses are locked in   4. Tendies      So I was sucking on the Frosty machine at Wendy's when I decided to look into what it might mean for GME when it moves from the Russell 2000 (small cap) to the Russell 1000 (large cap) in May and June.  This typically doesn't mean much for a single stock, but with the volatility we've seen with GME already, as well as the percentage change in market cap, I think this may be more significant for GME than most companies.  FTSE Russell does a big giant rebanlacing that lasts about two months in May and June.  Link here for the 2020 schedule. [https: www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule](https: www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule) .  The 2021 dates aren't released yet but should be basically the same.  Because of the recent run-up in price on GME, it is set for a move from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000.  This same price increase also left many active fund managers underweight in GME, and they are losing out on recent gains.  All of this means Russell 2000 active fund managers who are underweight in GME right now, only have about 2-3 months to attempt to fix it before it gets taken out of the index, and their under performance on GME gets locked in.  It's quite possible that they are helping to form a large part of the floor, and their increasingly desperate attempts to not have the underweight GME locked in at re-balancing time will cause more and more volatility as the deadline approaches.   A recent comparison I would like to make is to TSLA, both because of its retail popularity, short interest, and volatility leading up to SP500 inclusion.  S&P announced that TSLA would be added to the index on Nov. 17, 2020, and it was officially added on Dec. 21. In that time, it's stock price went from $441 to $649, with an overall increase in market cap of over $200 billion dollars.  With a current market cap of around $5-10 Billion dollars depending on the day, it takes a lot less money to move the price on GME, and with the high likelihood of underweight Russell 2000 index funds, we may see even more volatility leading up May/June than we have so far this year.  &#x200B;  Disclosure - I am long GME.  This is not financial advice.  I used to work at Wendy's but was fired."

My personal opinion: I do not like those bonuses as many of us emptied their saving to protect this stock from HF. I do hope to see some support from the company itself. However, sinking the stock will not only hurt those of us who can't short, cripple those with high averages and ultimately stand against all of what we have been fighting for.

There’s a saying in business: “When you aren’t paying, you’re the product.” For Robinhood, this is indeed the case."" **READ THE LINK------>>>>**[**https: medium.datadriveninvestor.com/robinhood-lends-your-shares-to-short-sellers-and-keeps-all-the-proceeds-78353ca33fb9**](https: medium.datadriveninvestor.com/robinhood-lends-your-shares-to-short-sellers-and-keeps-all-the-proceeds-78353ca33fb9) READ THE LINK:[https: medium.datadriveninvestor.com/robinhood-lends-your-shares-to-short-sellers-and-keeps-all-the-proceeds-78353ca33fb9](https: medium.datadriveninvestor.com/robinhood-lends-your-shares-to-short-sellers-and-keeps-all-the-proceeds-78353ca33fb9) I will be messaging you in 1 month on [**2021-03-28 07:42:16 UTC**](http: www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-03-28%2007:42:16%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https: np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu94mx/weird_stuff_afoot_1/gp55dez/?context=3)  [**3 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https: np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Flu94mx%2Fweird_stuff_afoot_1%2Fgp55dez%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-03-28%2007%3A42%3A16%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.  ^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https: np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20lu94mx)  *****  |[^(Info)](https: np.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https: np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https: np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https: np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)| |-|-|-|-| I will be messaging you in 6 days on [**2021-03-06 06:07:04 UTC**](http: www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-03-06%2006:07:04%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https: np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu5g54/the_profit_says_brk_will_beat_spy_again_cheap/gp4s6u1/?context=3)  [**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https: np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Flu5g54%2Fthe_profit_says_brk_will_beat_spy_again_cheap%2Fgp4s6u1%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-03-06%2006%3A07%3A04%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.  ^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https: np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20lu5g54)  *****  |[^(Info)](https: np.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https: np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https: np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https: np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)| |-|-|-|-| ""What may infuriate WSB users, is the fact that their shares are made available to lent for the very short-selling hedge funds they are battling it out against.

Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down.

And one is 1 dollar in SNDL because I’m lazy and want to watch the price change on my homepage. 16 options open, 13 of em red?? Half of them expire in March! It’s going to be great, right? Right? Yep 33 days and the truth hurts. I’m all for making a quick dollar but a lot of you guys miss lead young people into losing the life savings to make a dollar for your self. (Wolf of Wall Street) I have lost a dime in the whole GME/AMC/SNDL thing that has happened but I’ve heard about and it’s sad. For starters game stop as a business is crap. All the kids that probably lost there money in the market are the same kids that got ripped by the stores. They ones who have made out are the CEO and other officers that had free stock given to them... not you guys. And all you did was make a group of shit head CEO’s richer..if they wanted to fix the company they would have rolled there gains into making it a better company and not calling it quits. Mind you I have lost a dime... never bought a single share. So I have nothing invested in it. I have putts that AMC drops but that’s the inevitable. Netflix and HBO max are gonna put them out of business anyways. Nobody goes to the theater anymore pre COVID they didn’t either, unless it was Star Wars movies. All of you know I’m right. I’m glad some of you have gain a lot but remember that when you win someone else will lose and some day you will be on the losing end. SNDL IS THE WAY THEY HAVE ZERO DEBT & OVER $610M IN UNRESTRICTED CASH FROM RECENT CAPITAL RAISES READY TO SEE THIS TAKE OFF BACK & BEYOND $13 A SHARE  💸💰🤑🚀🤘👩‍🚀💎👐🌜🌎💯 People think you mean weed for smoking but really you are putting it in SNDL. 100% SNDL? Fucking SNDL you people really are retarded Gonna buy some more AMC-D and SNDL-T on Monday... See what I did there...lol SNDL ftw SNDL could be an easy quick 100-300% gain again like last time Pump it up then take those profits to buy more GME to hold! I could buy so much SNDL with that kind of a return. Not to mention a little of this and a little of that. As Canadians you should also be pushing SNDL for round 2.. Daddy Elon loves smoking weeds (SNDL that is) Hey WSB Don’t forget about your love of SNDL That 4 bagger plus run helped fund your second round of GME and AMC Come back this week to SNDL for another funding Quick 2-4 bagger just waiting to be started Probably YOLO’d SNDL at the top and can’t get in on the action They restricted SNDL as well Don’t forget where your extra funds came from WSB Boost SNDL next week to gain more for the GME and AMC run I have no more money. SNDL is the only Calls I own Here we have a fallen soldier, SNDL is dead, the money that was going to be made has already been made. I have some SNDL options expiring in April myself. Oops I also have a call on SNDL set to expire on 3/5. Let’s cross our fingers. If I could only have one stock it would be SNDL too! SNDL felt like insiders trying to beat the last offering at .75 and make a profit before the next PL statements were seen.  This is not financial advice and I’m plagiarizing from smart people. I’m just a caveman. I've got 1200 shares at $3, and that's after averaging down from 900 at $3.50.  So it looks like selling weeklies at $5/contract for the foreseeable future.  Although, a couple of weeks ago, I sold biweeklies at $25/contract, but right after SNDL came down from the high.  Figure I'll recoup my $1800 loss in 30 weeks.  And who said meme stocks aren't fun? SNDL will be making that parabolic moves within a few months....his account gonna be positive again IMO. Heck, it's a great dip buy right now IMO."

APE LIKE VERY MUCH This went on longer than the big dip. And it was worth EVERY FUCKING SECOND. Jesus man, do you ever sleep?  You’ve been making a negative AMC post EVERY hour for the past two days.  How much are you getting paid?  Just curious. All I know is that my portfolio balance stayed relatively untouched over the last week.  I had two friends doing some VERY heavy lifting. And I will thank them by burning them alive to send a message. HOLD BATTLE BRUTHAS!! FOR THE GLORY OF THE IMPERIUM!!! DO YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE MEME  MEMEING THE STOCKS OF ANGRY MEN  IT IS THE MEMEING OF A PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT BE FUCKED AGAIN  WHEN THE BEATING OF YOUR HEARTS ECHOES THE BEATING OF HEDGE FUNDS  THERE IS A LIFE ABOUT TO START WHEN THE TENDIES COME Shorting has its merits, but in my opinion there needs to be transparency as well as a hard cap on the % of float that can be shorted. Shorting is too easy for the hedgies to use and abuse which they can and do at will with enough volume to have a noticeably negative impact. They don’t usually do it because of the fundamentals, but for profit. It’s bullshit what they can do to a stock - screwing over honest ppl who actually believe in the stock they invested in by shorting it to increase their profitability. Apple is the most valuable company in the world. They had a great earnings call this month. No reason to lose over 10 bucks of share in value like they have. I saw SAVA and TLRY shoot up in value and close at I think 117 and 65 or so respectively one day. Why? So higher OTM options are rolled out the next day. What happens the next day? Price falls by 50% rendering those OTM calls useless. First time GME shot to 150 - they were allowed to because they stopped shorting for a brief period. Why? To have any limit sells trigger in the 100-150 range and that day 150 was the highest OTM call option available. Shenanigans!! On the VERY small chance they did block selling, I imagine that would be more down to the brokerages themselves and their middlemen who are unwilling to allow us to have a claim to those astronomical prices because they don't want to/can't handle that amount. They blocked buying because apparently it was too risky for them/us to keep it open. Now while that might be complete bullshit, and obviously it would work differently in the event of a sell-block, I again, just wanted to raise the point and start a conversation about it. Is it possible, and if so, how would it affect us if implemented? THE VICTORY MARCH HAS NOW BEGUN 📈🚀 Thank god APHA and TLRY aren’t on there....now maybe we can make some money Again, although there is a very strong correlation that doesn't mean they are causing one another. There is a possibility of a third variable causing both to rise and fall in a VERY similar way. For example rising interest rates in the US. Also covariance is nothing more than a standardized correlation, it has nothing to do with direction. $APHA shareholders stand to gain “free money” via the gap when the $TLRY deal closes 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Aphria $APHA cultivates and sells medical and recreational cannabis through retail and wholesale channels in Canada and internationally.     🚀 On Dec. 16, Aphria and Tilray $TLRY announced a merger to form the largest cannabis company in the worldby revenue. The company will keep the Tilray name, including the ability to consolidate production in Canada, combine alcohol and CBD businesses in the United States in preparation for potential federal legalization, and the ability to combine efforts in Europe.    🚀 In a reverse merger structure, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share, implying a 23% premium to Tilray’s share price before the announcement. Given relative sizes, Aphria shareholders will own about 60% of the combined company and get seven of the nine board seats. Tilray CEO and Chairman Brendan Kennedy will get one of Tilray’s two board seats, while Aphria CEO and Chairman Irwin Simon will keep both roles in the combined company.    🚀 Its pending merger with Tilray boosts its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Deal terms seem fair to both sides. Aphria added recreational cannabis after Canada’s legalization in October 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Aphria’s recreational and wholesale cannabis revenue accounted for roughly 41% of total cannabis and distribution revenue. Unlike many of Aphria’s competitors that immediately focused on creating consumer packaged goods for the recreational market, Aphria initially focused on flower and vape. However, it is now beginning to expand into edibles.    🚀 On Feb. 1, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Ron Wyden announced their intentions to push major federal cannabis legislation. They plan to release a discussion draft in the early part of this year. Legalization is likely going to take a couple of years, as forecasts estimate a change to federal law by 2023. Nevertheless, legalization sooner than that would unlock growth and capital access sooner but doesn’t change our estimated market potential of $85 billion by 2030 compared with an estimated $15 billion in 2020, according to the Marijuana Business Daily.    🚀 Aphria has an extensive international distribution business, which generated the majority of net revenue in 2020, a far larger portion than many of its Canadian cannabis peers. The global market looks lucrative given higher realized prices and growing acceptance of the medical benefits of cannabis. Exportersbmust pass strict regulations to enter markets, which protects early entrants like Aphria. Due to climate, much of Canada’s cultivation is in greenhouses or indoors. Recent expansions in outdoor production are likely limited to extracted products due to quality. Aphria revised plans to build production in Colombia due to high capital costs, instead exporting global medical markets from its Canadian facilities.     🚀 Forecast estimate roughly 16% average annual growth through 2030 for the global medicinal market excluding Canada and the U.S. Aphria's 2020 acquisition of SweetWater, a U.S. craft brewery, still leaves it out of the U.S. THC or CBD market. Its strategy appears to predict that future cannabis distribution looks more like alcohol or tobacco than the current multi-state operator strucure of today. The U.S. offers the fastest growth of any market globally. However, the regulatory environment is murky with individual states legalizing cannabis while it remains illegal federally.  Federal law will eventually be changed to allow states to choose the legality of cannabis within their borders.    TLDR;;  🚀🚀🚀🚀 Aphria's merger with Tilray grows its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Aphria’s focus on strategic SG&A spending and running a lean business model allows it to have a healthy cash balance to fund future operations and investments. Aphria's careful approach to expansion has allowed it to reach profitability faster than any of its Canadian peers. This only makes sense if the gap remains consistent at the moment when shares are converted. Over the past couple of weeks, the gap between APHA and TLRY has been decreasing. Another thing to keep in mind is that when the conversion occurs, new shares will be introduced to TLRY, thus lowering the overall price of the stock. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD. This. And won’t it dilute the TLRY shares? Making the merger a pretty 1:1 transition for shareholders? BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon.  HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK. $GME, $BB, $NOK, $AMC Option Expiry Today - VERY CLOSE TO BEING HUGE People don't seem to fully appreciate HOW many options are VERY CLOSE to being in the money expiring today. As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will.

Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.  This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).  It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.  There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.  AMC has A LOT MORE: [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.  BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.  NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.  Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).  Everyone have a great weekend.  Disclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only. Do your own research. Not financial advice. Eat crayons.     EDIT 2: fucked formatting **TL;DR RKT is going to bull run all the way to the 9th March after its beautiful earnings and it's time to burn some shorts.**  Yesterday pre-earnings I posted some [DD](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsdpuz/rkt_to_the_moon_dd_and_short_squeeze_opportunity/) on why RKT (Rocket Companies) was a buy. I was right, the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10% from highs of a 20% gain during the day. To someone that has not followed RKT this may seem like a missed opportunity. WRONG. Welcome to the Amazon of the Finance World (well near enough).  Rocket by all traditional measures should've risen to $25 (previous close of $19.90) minimum today. Their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past. Practically since the IPO institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls, some covered, some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between $19 and $21 or to average down from a bag holding position above. These players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase (a potential gamma squeeze if it did so). Hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below $22.  **Next week, things start to change...**  But before that let's just go over the insane earnings they just report:  1. **EPS $1.09** (analyst prediction $0.87) an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from $754 million to $2.84 billion. 2. A **special dividend of $1.11** per share to Class A common stock holders on March 9th (note this is important autists). 3. **Partnerships with a multitude of companies including JP Morgan**. 4. Stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended. 5. There's more little nuggets but that's enough for ape brain to take in.  **So what happens next week?**  Firstly the dividend at current stock price is just over **5% yield**. An insane amount. This provides a catalyst for the price in two ways. Firstly, who doesn't want any easy 5% return? This is hardly priced in let's be realistic. These earnings give RKT as **PE of 5**. Way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around **3 to 4 times too small** if you consider them a Fintech.  More importantly, let's have a look at RKT's **short interest**. It lies somewhere between 35% and 40%. Now let's be clear this isn't going to be a Reddit, retail investor driven **short squeeze**, RKT has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million BUT if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure. Shorts have to pay the dividend - an instant 5% loss is not a good look and who knows if there'll be more to come in later earnings. With call holders less in the equation, the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies. It's time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the IPO.  Everyone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover, and 40% of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me. A huge difference between RKT and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above $30 indefinitely (or higher). Shorts don't like to be stuck indefinitely losing, unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse - not that they will unless you all have weak hands. Expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around $30+ to drive the price up more.  With all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of March. I have a genuine PT after that earnings of $40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ship's favour the moon is only the beginning. This Rocket is going up Uranus like your wife's boyfriend's is up hers.  Rocket is recruiting diamond hands, I am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10% profit BUT autists and apes we can get 100%, 200% or more!  RKT closed at $21.85 today. It is my firm believe RKT is a **brilliant buy** after these earnings under $24 and if the bull run starts all the way to $30. Management want these shorts out and that's good enough for me, the CEO laughed at the shorts on CNBC.  I am willing to put my money where my mouth is as I averaged up from $30 per cent equivalent CfD contracts at $20.30 to $41 per cent equivalent at $20.91.  In other words get us to $46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade. These values are actually GBP but I presumed you only know dollar due to autism.  **I just like the stock. So buy shares, squeeze shorts.**  **RKT TO THE MOON!**  [Earnings Call Transcript](https: www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/)  EDIT: VERY IMPORTANT POINT - some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95% is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion not far off GME. Just more reason to buy  Disclaimer: This is not financial advise and should not be taken as such. (SEC scares me)  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/t4b0ga009wj61.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=988cbd4e0b73580ab34b8bdd4fbe20efac64b9af    Grocery Outlet is a boomer bet with overtones of possible insane growth.                            First, the bedrock boomer shit. Grocery outlet buys strategically so they can offer products for 50% to 70% cheaper than the competition., Essentially, they allow my broke ass to eat organic ribeye every night if i so choose.   GO has just 375 locations in 6 states.   Their most recent 10k was released in 2019 and stated they have a longterm potential of 4,800 locations nationwide. GO is just getting started.  Their longterm growth is projected as 14.7% as compared to industries 12.4% in 2019.   They plan to expand their number of locations by at least 10% a year. This alone gets my dong hard.  As stated in their 10k, their management is not accustomed to operating a publicly owned business. This sounds bad, but is actually a good thing imo. GO is already an amazing business model. Imagine if an Ackman/R. Cohen type character came in and bought a huge chunk or the company installed a few heavy hitters to help scale the business.In fact,last week they added Maria Fernanda Meija(former VP Kellogg's) and Gail Moody-byrd(AI marketing analytics at noodle.ai)  to the board.           The above would be enough to get me to invest if i were a boomer, but as a WSB mutant, I need a possibility of a tendie volcano. Now for storytime.  HOW GROCERY OUTLET OFFERS DEEP DISCOUNTS If a store overstocks, a truck gets misdirected, packaging changes, production changes, or any such interruption in the ""Chain of freshness"" occurs, GO capitalizes on this while saving the other company from taking losses.        THE CHAIN OF FRESHNESS  You may have heard that up to a third of all food produced by Americans is thrown away. https: www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/491513/  The Chain of Freshness describes how this happens and how food MOVES. 1. Food is grown  2. Food sent to be processed and/or packaged/branded. 3. It goes to warehouse(this  sometimes involves many layers of regional and local warehouses.) 4. It goes to a store 5.You buy it.  Anywhere during this chain, product can get slowed down. It wont be fresh enough to  be accepted at the next checkpoint in the Chain, so it goes into a dumpster. Although the ""actual freshness"" of the product may be fresher than you would ever see at a store, its not fresh enough to  go to regional, then local distributors before landing at the store not only fresh enough to consume, but fresh enough to be able to sit on the shelf for however long is required by the stores business plan.   This would be a good time to state that im technically an ""industry insider"" as ive been dumpster diving for years. Ive seen warehouse dumpsters full to the top with product all packaged and nice, fresher than you would ever see at a store. You may have heard in the news recently about portland police guarding dumpsters full of food from citizens. Fred Meyer said the food was spoiled, but it was just unsellable due to liability issues and food quality laws. Perfectly edible food. https: apnews.com/article/portland-storms-oregon-4eebd2cd2f1b9f798667994bc871a647  This is just the tip of the iceberg, as warehouse dumpsters are usually behind fences and guarded with cameras so no one sees that waste, except for me. I fill my backpack with organic chocolate, hipflasks of brandy, and have personally recovered enough frozen marinated ribs to grill up and play Meat Jenga with(which we actually did.)  This waste is caused by logistics problems which could be alleviated by Grocery Outlet, adding value to everyone involved                   Now imagine this company if Food Waste Laws are passed, penalizing companies who waste food. With images of cops chasing people away from a dumpster full of perfectly good food in the news, the discussion is very likely to surface among other progressive talking points. Grocery Outlet is uniquely positioned to profit from this trend. If Companies were all of a sudden compelled to reduce their waste, it would be a huge growth opportunity. Just based on their current guidance GO is a great bet. But in this rapidly changing world, a newly public company like GO with an innovative business model can change its current guidance multiple times.  Tldr; a long standing glitch in the logistics of how we sell and move food around leads to dumpsters full of perfectly good food that makes up about a third of all the food Americans produce. GO has a unique business plan that, with the help of a big-dick activist investor,  hiring of corporate heavy hitters, and the Possibility of Food Waste Laws could turn those dumpsters full of food into dumpsters full of money for everyone involved.  Heres a link to an article that has the numbers I referenced. https: finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-grocery-outlet-144102370.html  Positions: All shares, about 10% of my investment capital. Long hold. I literally love the stock. I identify with grocery outlet on an emotional level. They allow me to buy all the fancy snacks I like and my loyalty to them is the closest ive come to  truly experiencing religion in my life. Courtesy of u/brawnerboy  I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https: www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)  If you haven't already, you should read it.  Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.  Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90  &#x200B;  Edit: This is not financial advice I am retarded but I like this stock  Edit: As of 3:15 today the short interest has increased from 38% to 81%"

Great way to spend Sunday before market opens and I double down on some shares and calls!  I am genuinely interested to hear from all the naysayers though who don’t believe in the stock and I’m going to make a post for discussion so we can all see where these people are coming from!  Also, thank you so much for the support on my most successful post so far! I am glad so many of you are reaching out to me to learn more about how I am approaching this and how it’s possible to jump on this ship without losing money!   Of course these are my opinions and I’m only saying what I would do/have done to keep me in the green even when the stock tanked last week by utilizing options and not setting the expiration for February 28th...  Anyways, my goal is to educate. If you have a differing opinion please explain it instead of tearing people down so we can all learn and grow together!  Maybe I am a little naive and innocent to believe we are here to support one another and that we all want to prosper together... Maybe. BUT that won’t stop me from trying!  Will I make a post like this again?  Yes.   What if you get hate?  I’ll STILL EFF’NG DO IT AGAIN  There’s more positivity here than hate.   Special Thank you to those of you also answering peoples questions about the stock and how to get in! This is why the stock will surge again! If we teach people how to invest more wisely it will reduce the need to paper hand for %20-%200 and cash out options at 500%-1000%+ so they can buy more shares!  Maybe some don’t want this. I dunno. But I want to find out so we move forward again!  Also, yes I own both GME and AMC in shares and options and my options are worth more than my shares for anyone wondering and I’m BUYING MORE tomorrow! Or Friday when it dips again   Why did I make this comment long?  Sorry lol That is the most expensive option and not necessary at all! But you can do it if you have the money because it is safer. Remember: time is key so set a longer expiration and sell whenever you feel like it for a profit. Buy some shares with a little of your earnings to give back to gme and support your fellow apes lol   If you don’t mind 300%-400% profit with a lower buy in, set the call higher in anticipation of it rising. For example: gme is 99.50$ per share;  You can buy calls less than 99.50$ and already be ITM (in the money) so once the stock RISES you can sell at anytime for profit because people will want your contract since it is now cheaper than buying a stock. They pay a premium which is your profits and you sell to them.   Or, you buy a $200 call which is OTM (out of money) which costs less because it’s more of a gamble. But, in the case of gme we know it’s going to moon, and so do many others so you buy this instead. As the stock rises, the premium goes up because people who didn’t buy are becoming more desperate to get in and are will to pay whatever you choose to sell it for because you know a squeeze is imminent. In this case your $200 call could be worth as much or MORE than what you paid because there is demand for it!  Tl;dr: if you have the money, buy calls at lower strikes and profit, if you have less buy OTM contracts and STILL make bank (maybe not as much, but still 5 figures plus per contract).   Phew. A little DD:  What is driving profits in options is IV (implied volatility) which is based off of supply and demand. What you are describing is closer to day trading when you buy a stock, hope it rises and sell at a profit. Options IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE (sorry I can’t stress that enough) are different, where the contract price is not directly based off of stock price, but demand for that particular contract. For example: when gme hit $170 last week; my 800$ call shot up to $4500 (I bought for 82$) AND my $5 put jumped %200.   The key here is my $800 call was worth more even though gme did not hit $800. That is because someone (maybe even hedges) wanted that contract and were bidding to buy it because they know a gamma is imminent and they want to buy it off me now as opposed to taking the risk that goes to $10000 (as an example).   Okay, simple version:  Due to high demand, and the belief and knowledge that a gamma is imminent, simply OWNING a call is now worth more than owning a share, because the the value of getting a contract early, which gives you right to buy a stock at a set price, is now worth more than buying a share and holding.   Here is why it is somewhat safer than owning shares (just an opinion): if you buy a share for $100 and the stock rises to $200 you make $100 profit. If you buy a contract, you can spend $100 and get access to a contract worth a hundred shares. If the stock goes to $200 you make $200x100 minus what you paid so $20000-$100 when you sell it. Crazy right?   When the stock goes down to $50, if you own the stock, you lose $50 in value, with options, if it expires you lose the $100 (so don’t diamond hand a contract). BUT you can sell the option off at ANYTIME and possibly make profits. It’s not possible anymore to buy a call for $100 because the squeeze is imminent unfortunately, but dig and find the cheapest options you can get your hands on.   This is a very rough, but basic understanding of options. It gets more complicated than that, but for the sake of gme this is the core fundamentals of how I made so much money off of a single squeeze and how you can too!  Wow I wrote more than I wanted too! I’m sorry lol *Gets Squoze*  ^Goddammit!  Seriously? Naked shorts? **THATS THE OLDEST SCHEME IN THE BOOK!** I’m a retard!  #IM MORE RETARDED THAN ANY OF YOU!

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)  \----------  Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https: www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https: www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https: www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.  \----------  For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:  ""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xw8lu1l122k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=644af631e8387d60cb475e33e67fcd1c66018b8d What happen when you buy a stock and the price goes down?😳😳😳BUY MORE!!!🚀 I don't understand. ANYTHING !!! TELL ME MORE FUCCKING WSB !!! People don't seem to fully appreciate HOW many options are VERY CLOSE to being in the money expiring today. As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will. Remember each 1 option = 100 shares.  Sort by VOLUME  $GME   [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme)   29,097 contracts @ $800   10,905 contracts @ $200   10,418 contracts @ $150  This is HUGE volume.

Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.  This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).  It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.  There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.  AMC has A LOT MORE: [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.  BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.  NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.  Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).  Everyone have a great weekend.  Disclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only. Do your own research. Not financial advice. Eat crayons.     EDIT 2: fucked formatting Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction.

It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date! ME OMY TO BUY MORE SHARES @ MARKET OPEN BOUGHT MORE! LET'S DRIVE AMC AND GME TO THE FREAKING SKY!!!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Courtesy of u/brawnerboy  I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https: www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)  If you haven't already, you should read it.  Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.  Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90  &#x200B;  Edit: This is not financial advice I am retarded but I like this stock  Edit: As of 3:15 today the short interest has increased from 38% to 81%"
NK,20,67," Buy AMC and GME  HOLD BY SUMER TIME BOTH STONK  WILL 🚀🌝🦍💎✋🏼 Won’t it have to go to like $1100 to get $1.7m?  MONEY IN THE BANK 🚀🚀🚀 I was thinking of this on Friday over at AMC when I was scooping up shares under 7.97. I was like, ""go ahead, i WANT you to push it down, because now they're MINE. I. DRINK. YOUR. MILKSHAKE. I DRINK IT UP! #I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE MELVIN!!! EZ STONK ADVICE I DRINK YOUR MILSHAKE  SCHHHHHHHLURP  I DRINK IT UP Fuck, that scene is so fucking good. ""I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE ELI! I DRINK IT UP!"" remember like 16 years ago when I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE was a meme lmao I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE SLUUUUUUURP!! I have never forgotten the “I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE! I DRINK IT UP!” WE DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE. NO! I want you to keep buying the $10 stock because I’m making huge profits on the PUTS! THANK YOU!!!! You think because you blocked a few brokers that we will stop buying stonks?   THINK AGAIN! YES *** DAMN IT YES! THAT IS RIGHT I DID IT!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!  THATS RIGHT!  WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE??  I AM!!! 🗣💪🏽🏋️‍♂️💪🏽💥💎 WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?! I AM!!!! Theyre acting intentionally malicious in abid to get us to sell so the hedge funds dont get screwed again. Theyre trying to play both sides of the short by giving themselves bonuses to make out while it goes up but using the negative pr if everyone decides to sell so they can short it again. But thats just a theory, a STONK THEORY. This isnt financial advice THANK YOU MAY I HAVE ANOTHER Like many folks here I am pretty new to wsb, been lurking since early Jan (lurker in general..), stumbled on the gme saga and was all in 55k on gme last run at average cost of 110. (500shares), bought from 30 to 325. Was up 150k (which would've be life changing)and heald until I paper handed for 111 when it really dropped. Contemplated my life choices and started reinvesting. Don't know why but I can't watch from the sidelines bought back in at 160 last week and averaged down to 125 by Friday with 150 shares. Got another 1k to fight with in monday and planning to get out of some positions for more ammo....I can wait to feast on moon berries with you fellow retards... 🚀 🚀 🌝 I’m going to join the “sus” train. Also in that 30 days done nothing but reply to your own garbage post attempting to do the Reddit version of screenshotting embarrassing tweets, or at least what you THINK should be embarrassing posts. Listen, I’m a < 30 day account ngl, but if I can prove to the Capthca that I’m real, I can prove it to you retards. yOu sOuNd lyKe BITCH STFU IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT YOU THINK 😘 Hey, if NKLA could pull something out of their ass to beat the earnings estimate and then spew some nonsense that makes it sound like they have an actual path forward towards increased profitability, WKHS can too.   Of course no one believed NKLA’s bullshit..."
PRI,17,15343," If you are not able to set a limit sell for $999,999.99, then as the OP suggests delete that limit sell order.  LETS ALL GET THE BEST PRICE!!! The current rules state if a customer cannot post the margin for their short position and the broker has to force liquidate then the broker has to BUY THE SHARES ON THE OPEN MARKET AT ANY PRICE. The price will go high enough to lure in holders of shares to actually sell. Many people will likely sell before 100k per share. Fails–to–Deliver — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares.   Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days.   According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market.   This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.  This means that the buyer of the contract is able to request the stock for that contract from the seller. If you never had the stock to begin with, THATS A PROBLEM.  If you sold this contract naked, now you have to go in the market to buy it AT ANY PRICE or risk massive fines and sanctions.

The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
SND,17,130," C PLTR $40 June 2022; C SNDL $2 1/2023; C KO 1/2023 $55; C WBA $60 1/2023; C PFE 1/2023 $40. Something’s gotta pay off. Lmao. I have like two stocks that I have shares in? And one is 1 dollar in SNDL because I’m lazy and want to watch the price change on my homepage. 16 options open, 13 of em red?? Half of them expire in March! It’s going to be great, right? Right? People think you mean weed for smoking but really you are putting it in SNDL. 100% SNDL? Fucking SNDL you people really are retarded Gonna buy some more AMC-D and SNDL-T on Monday... See what I did there...lol I could buy so much SNDL with that kind of a return. Not to mention a little of this and a little of that. As Canadians you should also be pushing SNDL for round 2.. Hey WSB Don’t forget about your love of SNDL That 4 bagger plus run helped fund your second round of GME and AMC Come back this week to SNDL for another funding Quick 2-4 bagger just waiting to be started Probably YOLO’d SNDL at the top and can’t get in on the action They restricted SNDL as well Don’t forget where your extra funds came from WSB Boost SNDL next week to gain more for the GME and AMC run I have no more money. SNDL is the only Calls I own Here we have a fallen soldier, SNDL is dead, the money that was going to be made has already been made. I have some SNDL options expiring in April myself. Oops I also have a call on SNDL set to expire on 3/5. Let’s cross our fingers. If I could only have one stock it would be SNDL too! I've got 1200 shares at $3, and that's after averaging down from 900 at $3.50.  So it looks like selling weeklies at $5/contract for the foreseeable future.  Although, a couple of weeks ago, I sold biweeklies at $25/contract, but right after SNDL came down from the high.  Figure I'll recoup my $1800 loss in 30 weeks.  And who said meme stocks aren't fun?"

These guys have billions to play with and they are making money buying dips and selling options too. They are slowly covering because of limited supply. Once inflation heats up bond yields will shrink the market and suddenly their money pool will become less plentiful. That's when the squeeze will squozen in my retarded opinion.  Synthetic shares are infinite as long as the price points land perfectly. That's why price should be ignored because it's being manipulated to get tens of millions in calls and shorts. Also notice only losses are being advertised and not gains by the media. Why did they ""bail out"" Melvin? The inflation incoming will prove their short positions right before GME can change longterm. Just buy, hold, until the tendieman cometh. They'll eventually win, but we'll win first.  NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE AND JUST CRAYON INFUSED MUSINGS. JUST A GUESS,,, but I think opening bell the Heggies will hammer GME to drive the stock down,,, might be a good time to pick up a few more shares.,, I Fully believe the fed Reserve and anything Like it has put trillions into s tock and C rypt o JUST to be able to manipulate Always. When they say it on the news... they call it ADDING or SUBTRACTING ""SOME"" points. Because this reason or that I MUST watch this movie immediately... I woke up 5am today, because I was knocked out at 830 last night and writing to you guys now. Why is that relevant? Because I'm also one of the dumb apes in on this, reading reddit daily since the Jan 29th debacle. I decided to write this for many reasons, read if yall want. One of the reasons is I don't or can't talk to anyone right now about Gme for obvious reasons. ""sell that shit, the volume doesn't look right, well TV said this bla bla bla""   JUST FUCKING DIAMOND HANDS. Jesus christ buddha  No proof or DD just opinions.   1. First things first, what people have to realize is our society is based on and run on profits. (more so in America) Financial, health, food, education industry, all them big dogs 1% etc want profits.   2. Now that you know that, they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make said profits. Some stay in the straight and narrow, the rest is that 1%. I get it, you want to make money, everyone does. So they find ways to evade tax, pay off people, make friends with higher-ups coughgovernmentofficials. This is all theory. Take it as you will.   3. I explain 1 and 2 because it leads me to 3. Jan 28th or 29th or whatever, all I needed to read was some hf was suspicious of ""making things up to profit"" and unfortunately got caught by Mr dfv.   4. 1 2 and 3 is what leads me to believe at that point that the squeeze is real. I read absolutely no DD and know nothing about stocks, and never read anything on wsb because I don't bet on what I can't win. I opened up Fidelity account cuz you know. RH. That was the other thing that set me off. RH, read 1 and 2.  Below are just rants now.   5. The squeeze is real. Read 1 & 2 & 3  6. You ain't diamond hands unless you read like 20 DDs minimum a day. To be a diamond hand, don't worry about shills and all those short ladder attack, Silver, open court cases, short interests reports, dips, tweets etc, because read 1, 2 and 3. That's all you need to care about.   7. The more I read DDs since early February, the more I bought in, like 3 times actually.   8. To me in the beginning, this was not an investment but a BET. Hence wsB. But the bet payout was this:  A. In the beginning my head was, spend 10 dollars, you get 3 outcomes. You only lose maybe 1 to 3 dollars Max, if you bought low like 40 to 60 maybe. Ok we lose SOME money, just don't eat out next time or work an extra week or something for those of us fortunate to do so. Remember this is a BET. don't use what you can't afford.   B. You break even and get your money back, GME ain't going bankrupt ever, read the DDs, Ryan Cohen and crew. Also read 1 2 and 3, it's in media now.   C. With 10 dollars you make $1000 right? Win win? Nah dog, this payout is going to be 100k share +. Again read 1, 2 and 3. And now this went from a BET to an investment. Why? Because I don't bet what I can't win. I'm cheap like that.   9. Now people are day trading. To me it's like buying a 20 dollar scratch ticket to win 40 dollars. Then betting and buying more scratch ticket hoping you win, yall gonna sell and miss the squeeze guys, read 1 2 and 3 HODL. OR you can buy a 1 dollar scratch ticket, HODL for a rainy day and win 100k or more, multiplier of other apes holding too.  10. This is a once and lifetime opportunity. It's like going on let's make a deal TV show. You take the $2000 cash instead of picking what's behind curtain 1 2 and 3. Where in this case the curtain is certainly going to have alot more money and there's literally no zonks. Why? Read 1 2 and 3, that's why yall should HODL.   This is a roller-coaster of a ride. It went from me wanting to screw hedge funds over to me paying off my cc debts, to me paying off my house to me retiring, to me now wanting to do philanthropy and open businesses to help the regular folk and change peoples lives. But you can't do that shit with 10k a share or even 100k a share. It needs  fuck you money. Let's ALL make fuck you money guys. Apes strong, thanks for listening. I have no one to share this ride with. Please don't block me. Good luck guys, stay safe. Get some fucking sleep and stop reading reddit so much and just watch the ticker, cuz it's going to blast off as long as we hold. Why? Read 1, 2 and 3.  This is not financial advice etc. Just observation and personal opinions. Im pretty sure there's real data out there from those conspiracy heads but I'm too lazy to prove it and you know, read #2. This could all also blow over and we make no profit and doesn't blast off cuz why? Read #2.  TLDR: companies caught with pants down doing shady things for profit. We found out, it's an opportunity for a squeeze. All you need to know is these guys will do whatever it takes to get away with it. Hold, don't sell low, no need to day trade, wait for the squeeze, and we all make fuck you money. Everything else isn't worth reading or worrying about. God speed.   Edit: forgot TLDR: Here is the thing... at the end of the day, whether the short squeeze happens or not, with what this new board and Ryan Cohen are trying to do this is an extremely undervalued company. Right now sure it “doesn’t have the fundamentals” to back the price but I’m not here for what it’s doing right now I’m invested for where they are trying to take. As a gamer I think I know where they are trying to go and if they do it’s “fair value” will be much much higher than where it is now.   All in all stop worrying about “the squeeze” and if it happens. Its an added bonus.   JUST HOLD!   At least until you hear them announce their plans.   This is not financial advice and I have no idea what I’m talking about. Or, you could save your pennies for the last few months, finally scrape 50USD together that you can safely lose. Transfer it to your Wealth simple account. Then JUST BEFORE your money clears, watch the price shoot up from $48USD to over $100USD. Then you can cry like me. I bought one GME share at $40 and was talking to my spouse when it was at around $200 who was like “how many!? JUST ONE?!” But when i mentioned I have 100 of AMC at $7.77 (a significant number for me so i have found it easier to hold) it became “YOU SPENT $700 ON AMC?” “Well more like $800” “Can you pay rent this month?!”   But now guess who wants to buy in? ☺️☺️☺️ AMC/GMC YOU MUST MOVE TO A CASH ACCOUNT!!! I have no clue what the fuck you are talking about.  JUST TELL ME WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD YOLO MY NEXT PAYCHECK. &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xya25adl12k61.png?width=2801&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd38d15d50baf3f67144c20916bbffc469632009  Hello again my fellow apes🦍!  BOILERPLATE: I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀  WARNING: BY THE END OF THIS POST YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS EUPHORIA OR PREMATURE 🚀 SYNDROME. THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF 'CONFIRMATION BIAS'. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE.  [Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)  \----------  Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https: www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https: www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https: www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.  \----------  For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:  ""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xw8lu1l122k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=644af631e8387d60cb475e33e67fcd1c66018b8d AMC/GME STONKS: YOU MUST HAVE A CASH ACCOUNT!!"
AAP,16,191," I miss the time when we were talking about BABA NIO and AAPL on this sub 😭 The year is 2086. AAPL has been trading in a range between 121-124 for like 420 years now. Also, a loaf of bread costs $8,000 and gold somehow still sucks One thing is certain. AAPL will fuck me next week. So many people have gotten fuked on AAPL calls but I’m feeling it this week Roughly 4.4 billion dollars left AAPL in the last 10 minutes of trading on Friday I don't know what that number puports to show but it is either an error or meaningless.  Trying pulling up the same information from that site for AAPL or MSFT and you will see mutual fund ownership above 1000%.      In short these numbers are wrong and should be disregarded. We are trying to fuck with the algorithm right?? We’re into blue chips now. JNJ MCD T AAPL Found another AAPL jelq-er Sometimes. AAPL stonk only goes up. Except right now, and some other times too. 🤷🏻‍♂️🦍 i bought AAPL @$122 Yeahhhhh I bought 3/19 SPY puts to hedge AAPL calls and of course they continued to move opposite directions. I sold to close the position at a loss when SPY touched 378 Friday. [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates GME will 10x before AAPL. You should re-balance this high growth portfolio properly. No the trick is to buy different contracts at different strikes with different expirations.   I’ve never been sad buying an AAPL dip but this is not the way. What will 10x first, GME or AAPL from here? # 🐸 is getting ready to leap.  This is my first DD post so I would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions I am making here. But I thing that JFrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why.  # What do they do?  Their main product is JFrog Artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries (runnable code) and it also serves as a mirror repository - local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer JFrog X-Ray that scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities). This is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory, Artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator, with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock, with X-Ray it also helps to ensure food safety.  **You may have heard of the Solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack. In my professional opinion, the toolset JFrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security.** That is why I am very much a Bullfrog 🐂🐸. If there is interest, I will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one, this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very, very well going forward.  # Company background  They were founded in 2008 and there main product has been Artifactory ever since. It has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope, Sonatype Nexus, but Artifactory is better and cheaper. Sonatype started as a plugin for Artifactory that does something similar to X-Ray before X-Ray existed, then they copycatted the Universal Repo, so JFrog hit back with X-Ray. I have used both of these products over the years (since 2013) and I have worked in environments without, Artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company Intellectual Property.  Their product is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook. These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe**. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have over 90% renewal rate of their customers.  They acquired Shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory. Though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are Open Source.  Their focus lately has been on offering a SaaS model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier. This should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic.  They went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as Snowflake.  # Financials  I am including a couple of Comps here based on the segment they operate in. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software Team collaboration. I picked them as a comp because I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.  * As a high growth software company, unsurprisingly their GAAP earnings are negative. Surprisingly to me though, they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability.    * FROG: -$0.1861    * CRWD: -$0.4763    * TEAM: -$4.9355 * Their market cap    * FROG: $4.9 B    * CRWD: $47.8 B    * TEAM: $59.4 B * Their forward P/E Ratio    * FROG: 615    * CRWD: 771    * TEAM: 173 * They don’t have any long term debt * Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3 * Their margin is over 80% * Revenue is growing 44% YOY  # Ownership  65% owned by insiders and institutions  Most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Index Fund) that own it.  Their final lockup was just released on 2/16 after their earnings and insiders have through 3/13 to sell before they go back into lockup. This is similar to what happened with Palantir recently, but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell.  # TL;DR  They have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry. They are well managed and have good financials as well.  # Positions  420 shares and 61 options, I am planning to get 8 more options on Monday. If you haven't guessed yet, I like the stock. You can check my post history to see some YOLO posts from earlier this week. I will post another update when I am fully loaded with 420/69 to ride this 🚀  My EOY price target is at least $100/share from the current price which is at $53.49 on Friday.  # Fun Frog Fact  In 1992 Frogs were the first vertebrates to have sex in space.  &#x200B;  # Sources  The company's website  [https: jfrog.com](https: jfrog.com)  For research on financials I have used the Shwab's site, but you need to be a customer to access.

Praying it's done in TRIPLICATE; GME, AMC, NOK. Bring us littles with you. We're fun too! 💎💖🙌😂💖💎 I have Nokia. Lost quite a bit of my retirement funds when you guys ran it up. I didn’t notice until late in the day. But you backed out to soon. If I had known you were fucking the shorts, I would have played along. They’re asses. Nokia may be a long play. But they under valued when compared to ERIC. ERIC is at $12.50. Nokia went under $4.00 on Friday.   You guys could run NOKIA up over $80/share if you just stayed at it. The shorts took it under 4.00 by themselves. The FUCKS Buy NOK!!It's insanely cheap! If we had never split our focus from GME to all this stupid BB, AMC, NOK shit we would have squeezed GME already tards. Everyone should have just gone in on GME idiots Yeah sick of reading about amc.  There isn't even a short squeeze it's just like cineworld or cruise ship stonks.  Going up based on reopening and not going bankrupt.  Buy GME for the squeezening.  AMC literally doing nothing other than not going bankrupt.   GameStop is evolving and kicking out people in charge because they can't do anything to help the company move forward. We actually like the stock for what it is.  Amc just seemed like a side show that was there with NOK and other bs to take away hype, and you monkeys all bought it. Fuck you. Tits are jacked.  You all suck. Positions GME 200 shares @ $400+ 💎🍆🚀🦍💪 Poor NOK daddy still believes in you NOK for a moment then nope. And here I am rooting for NOK ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out) Can people shut up about RKT? It's the same as NOK. A scam by bots. I still like the GME stock but it seems to be an orchestrated dead cat bounce to get retail to FOMO in. Take a look at WSB and it clearly worked. It'll probably happen 2-3 more times in the future because people will bet the farm that GME goes up another 100-800% (and they would probably diamond hand for more because infinity gazillion is not a meme). Meanwhile, RKT is straight up free tendies with no downside risk. My prediction is that when RKT lands on the moon, the 7,000,000 new WSB members will FOMO in at the last minute (see Tilray, APHA, GME, AMC, NOK, BB, PLTR, etc...), and be stuck with the bag again. Then they will hate on whatever the next best play is before FOMOing into the top again. From what I remember I don’t think so. I know was still able to buy AMC & NOK when RH placed restrictions on them. The app wasn’t working, but I was able to go on the website & do it. Sounds decent to me. I was considering doing something like that with NOK, though I think they've stopped dividends for now. People don't seem to fully appreciate HOW many options are VERY CLOSE to being in the money expiring today. As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will. Remember each 1 option = 100 shares.  Sort by VOLUME  $GME   [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme)   29,097 contracts @ $800   10,905 contracts @ $200   10,418 contracts @ $150  This is HUGE volume. If the stock closes at $150 it can cause a chain reaction.  $BB   [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb)   6,665 contracts @ $11   2,483 contracts @ $12   1,692 contracts @ $10.50  $AMC   [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?p=amc](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?p=amc)   43,493 contracts @ $8 - WOW!   27,299 contracts @ $9   26,471 contracts @ $10  They can't let the price above $8!  $NOK   [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok)   4,064 contracts $4   3,417 contracts $4.50  &#x200B;  EDIT 1 @ 4:30PM:   **AMC closed at $8.01 AH $8.04**   **NOK closed at $3.92 AH $3.94**   **GME closed at $101.74 AH $100.55**   **BB  closed $10.05 AH $10.03**  Option holders have until 5:30PM to exercise any ITM options. Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.  This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).  It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.  There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.  AMC has A LOT MORE: [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.  BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.  NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.  Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).  Everyone have a great weekend.  Disclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only. Do your own research. Not financial advice. Eat crayons.     EDIT 2: fucked formatting"
DY,15,3639," I'M READY TO GET HURT AGAIN 🚀🚀🚀💎💎😎 For absolutely stunning bright colours of nature check out the TRAVOH channel!🏝☀️🤩 https: youtube.com/c/TRAVOH TENDY ISLAND 🏝🏝🏝🏝  Join the Reddit and share your own adventures and/or stories around the world 🌎 with the community! https: www.reddit.com/r/TRAVOH /I’ve seen outrageous posts and bets here recently, and people have lost money because they have no idea what they are doing. So, I’m just going to leave this here and post it again, or a long version throughout the week to lower this madness and save people from losing money. I honestly hope newcomers see this...  Tl;dr: STOP OVERTHINKING  Treat GME like a meme stock and buy on the dip. If you buy options, set the expiration for end of month/April. Doesn’t matter what the strike price is because of IV Crush. You can sell anytime without effecting the cause (always pay yourself, keeps your head clear). If you sell before stimmies, buy back in. Gamma is pending.   Longer version:  There will be a squeeze and a gamma squeeze this month (March). Follow the money/word of mouth. The real catalysts are social media and upcoming stimulus.   GME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks. It’s abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn’t matter what your strike price is. All that matters is the expiration. Set longer expirations for your calls/puts so you can sell whenever you feel like paying yourself and buy the shares to support the cause.   GME being a meme is not a bad thing. In fact, it’s why we can do this. You don’t need an over complicated strategy to make profit here. The stock will rise and gamma when the little people are given 600 billion dollars to invest. Hedge funds know this and will use this as the opportunity to win the war. This isn’t new information. This has been in play since January, possibly even before. Why did DFV set his calls to expire in April? Why are hedgies repositioning themselves? Why did shorties call foul play against us in January? Play it smart and safe and you won’t lose a dime and will make unbelievable profits.    Remember that we are small fish in a gigantic pond that has existed even before DFV decides to make his move. I can elaborate on this later. While we may be small fish, the great equalizer is the stimulus. Some of you don’t remember this: but shorties and hedgers cries foul play, blaming the government for giving people the power to take their profits because the stimulus gave millions of people the same buying power as hedge funds. Fueled by word of mouth, which travels at the speed of light because of social media, it created an explosion that they could not control, so they shut down the game. It will happen again.   I think people are overthinking this and coming up with convoluted plans, when all you have to do is buy and hold. Sell your options, but hold your shares. Rinse and repeat. It’s what hedge funds are doing. It’s all there if you look at the charts AND the options. Look at the whole picture and follow the money.   Cash app finally added GameStop to purchase, meaning ANYBODY can buy the stock, AND the the stimulus is on its way. Put it together. Don’t look for a made up catalyst. It’s right there in front of all of us. It happens with hertz, and it happened in January. Don’t underestimate the power of the Apes and social media.   I left a lot of things unexplained but you get the picture. Also, for those of you who are spreading the word, keep it up and ramp it up before the stimmies drop. Doing God’s work (not religious just an expression). I’ll see you all in Andromeda (galaxy far away because this is going intergalactic).   This is just my opinion, trying to save lives not give financial advise. If it sounds this way that’s interpretation.   I eat crayons and huff gas fumes for fun!  I hope all newcomers see this...  Edit: thank you all so much! I am replying to you Damn apes as fast as I can! Am I officially an Ape now? I love you guys and want ALL OF US to prosper! I left some things out like how “GameStop is a cow that produces infinite milk and that’s why shorties keep coming back to ‘squeeze’” but I thought it was implied lol my B. I was planning on making a more in-depth version of this post soon though!  Whenever you are confused and dissuaded by all the misinformation, come back here or speak my name.

I'd be doing exactly the opposite of what the HF's want, and that is to ignore the hype and never think about going long until it's back to fair value of around 15$. Don't be a sheep and believe the HF's bullshit - you really think their algos aren't making a busload of money going long and short on stocks when it suits them? Not to mention the money they make selling OTM calls/puts to us retards. The implied volatility intraday on Friday reached a high of around 600% on March 19 options!! That shit is crazy expensive and totally unsustainable!! DYOR Stfu rly with 800 fucktards. 800 is srsly the fucking ezpz squeeze. Gamma squeeze will happen if we all just hold @ ezpz squeeze.

DONT YOU WANT ME TO BE POORER THAN I ALREADY AM??? LETS SEE THOSE FCKING PUTS THEN YOU DIRTY LIMP DICK FCKS Fellow retards, I might be retarded but I'm just thinking about the future of GME. Ryan Cohen and team turned Chewy into a company worth 40 Billion. Currently trading at 103 a share. Chewy does not have a ton of assets its just an online e-commerce pet store. He beat Amazon out to become the primary pet supply online retailer.  GME actually has real assets, stores all across the country. Imagine what he could do with that. GME 3.8B market cap is absolutely undervalued.  Ryan Cohen saw an opportunity with gamestop, to take a dying company and turn it around doing what he ALREADY KNOWS HOW TO DO.  In short, I like the stock. If I can make some money on a squeeze I'm happy - if somehow things don't work out with a squeeze I'm happy to hold. I'm looking at bringing my average down soon and holding unless this thing pops off to the 1000s.  DFV is a very smart man.   Pos: 46 GME @ 133"
AAPL,15,182," I miss the time when we were talking about BABA NIO and AAPL on this sub 😭 The year is 2086. AAPL has been trading in a range between 121-124 for like 420 years now. Also, a loaf of bread costs $8,000 and gold somehow still sucks One thing is certain. AAPL will fuck me next week. So many people have gotten fuked on AAPL calls but I’m feeling it this week Roughly 4.4 billion dollars left AAPL in the last 10 minutes of trading on Friday I don't know what that number puports to show but it is either an error or meaningless.  Trying pulling up the same information from that site for AAPL or MSFT and you will see mutual fund ownership above 1000%.      In short these numbers are wrong and should be disregarded. We are trying to fuck with the algorithm right?? We’re into blue chips now. JNJ MCD T AAPL Found another AAPL jelq-er Sometimes. AAPL stonk only goes up. Except right now, and some other times too. 🤷🏻‍♂️🦍 i bought AAPL @$122 Yeahhhhh I bought 3/19 SPY puts to hedge AAPL calls and of course they continued to move opposite directions. I sold to close the position at a loss when SPY touched 378 Friday. [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates GME will 10x before AAPL. You should re-balance this high growth portfolio properly. No the trick is to buy different contracts at different strikes with different expirations.   I’ve never been sad buying an AAPL dip but this is not the way. What will 10x first, GME or AAPL from here?"

I'm subscribing to his theory on GME. There's a reason we did not see GME's stonk price plummet back down to $45 on Friday. It appears that the hedge funds are unloading hundreds of thousands of shares to start a chain reaction of panick selling. If us apes hold strong this bitch can hit the moon potentially on Monday from my understanding.  APES TOGETHER STRONG!!!   This is not financial advice. I'm a retard that chews their own toenails and eats ear wax. 🙌🏼💎APES TOGETHER STRONG💎🙌🏼 HOLDING STRONG 💎 🤚 BABY BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS.""

Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.  It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.  DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN.  It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair.

Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰  Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:  When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.  RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself).   $RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back.   It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT.   BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?  GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you.   The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.  Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November.   Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.  BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:  Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?    TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌   Edit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40.

Stream the game - bet on the game - all in the same app.  ER is coming Tuesday of next week. They've raised guidance **TWICE** prior to this earnings report.  We just had the SuperBowl - and March Madness is almost here, the subs are going to be up so bigly over the last Q it will blow your wives boyfriend for her.  The growth potential of FUBO is massive, its another changing of the tides moment where Americans are ditching cable TV providers in favor of streaming services. Think **NFLX**, **ROKU**, etc.. they've all replaced their archaic counterparts. **This is just the streaming end of the business.**  Now factor in the sports betting aspect ( **DKNG**, **PENN**, etc ) and the added value of doing all of this from the same fucking app. Sports betting is slowly rolling out across the entire country.   Its a perfect storm of fundamentals that support the bull case for FUBO.   &#x200B;  FUBO's current subscriber base is **500k paid subs**, but check this out:  >""About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.""  Thats approx. 220 MILLION sports fans in the us and 190 MILLION who have gambled in the past year.  Lets throw some modesty in here and say FUBO could capture **5%** of this market, aka **\~ 10 MILLION**  **20x their current subscriber base.** 20. Fucking. Times.  Thats if they capture 5% of the market which is pretty fucking reasonable considering there is very limited competition on the sports streaming side of things.  &#x200B;  Alright now let me really fuck you up....  &#x200B;  Lets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:  FUBO MARKET CAP: **$3.5 billion**  * NFLX - **$240 billion** * ROKU - **$50 billion** * DKNG - **$25 billion** * PENN - **$18 billion**  I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..  **FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR**  &#x200B;  There is also the potential for a short squeeze.

WF,14,165," Bring WWF back! Gawd I miss WWF and when we cheered for this shit like our humanity depended on it man, the WWF really used to put out some quality stuff When you refer to it as WWE in its prime.... 😂😂😂   WWF was its prime!!! McMahon was a great heel. 1998-1999 WWF was the peak. No, this was WWF in it's prime! I think this was still WWF man Your making me feel old with that....when I was young it was actually WWF But they changed their name around 1996 roughly to WWE. Same! Loved WWF and then they started calling it WWE. Agree/disagree because I'm old... I couldn't give a shit about wrestling now, because Santa Claus isn't real, but the late 80s early 90s WWF will always be prime to me.  I mean... Hulkamania, brother? Whoooooooo ric flair was definitely prime as nature boy. 25 different ultimate warriors because dudes kept dying... The heart foundation with that dick head with the megaphone (I can't remember his name). Been there so many times. Brings up those great memories of powerbombing my brother onto the couch then hitting him w/ the walls of Jericho.   Throw in a few ""chair shots"" with the couch cushions and a crippler crossface for good measure.... and one disgusting Mr. Socko to really highlight my victory. Then  running over to the 6 cd stereo player to blast a song from Monsters of rock, and walk down the hallway with my replica WWF championship belt. Absolutely no fkn better memories a child could ever have >The announcer was forced to kiss vince's ass in an earlier part of the story line iirc    Well, everyone had a ""role"".. and they all nailed it  >  WWF/WWE always been like a great movie or TV Show   Everyone had/has a script, and the rest depends on the male and female ""wrestlers/performers"" and their acting skills.  Most of them are all high level athletes IRL too   >  But Selling a story to the millions watching, and generating massive hype.. takes talent.    WWF and early 2000s WWE was the golden age. It lost some of the best people, and became more PG13 later on.. Then it just lost that enigma which made WWE a Multi-Billion dollar entertainment corporation with an enormous fan base world wide.   >  There was a time, when almost every young folk all around the world stayed glued to the TV on Monday and Friday nights.. religiously WWF No Mercy! Back then I created all of the kids who bullied me in school and then proceeded to lay the mothafukin smack down on their candy asses in first blood matches, TLC and hell in a cell. I've been seeing a lot of Uranium bull cases on WSB, r/investing, and r/stocks. A main point that keeps getting repeated is Biden = clean energy; nuclear = green energy. Unfortunately, I don't don't it's quite that simple.   Here are some points you may want to consider before YOLOing all your money. I'm not taking either a bull or bear position, but wanted to lend insight about the industry with my family of Reddit degenerates so we can help each other make money.   Nuclear power is a very productive source of energy globally and, unlike with fossil fuel combustion, its use does not increase greenhouse gas emissions or contribute to acid rain. It is safer to mine than coal, but reactor meltdown and contamination from breached nuclear plants are significantly more hazardous (e.g. Chernobyl, Fukushima Daiichi). In addition, the problem of high-level radioactive waste management has confounded us for decades, and government efforts to address the negative production externalities of nuclear power are a demonstration of spectacular bureaucratic failure.    Radioactive waste cannot be treated to make it nonradioactive, and thus storage is the only option. To my understanding, all radioactive waste produced by commercial power plants in the United States are currently in temporary storage, many of which are near capacity. We do have the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant ([WIPP](https: en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant)) in New Mexico for transuranic waste produced by our government during the creation of nuclear weapons; more than 3.7 million cubic feet of transuranic waste has been received by that facility (about half of its 6.2 million cubic feet capacity), but the site remains dedicated to defense-related radioactive waste containment. Further contributing to our nuclear waste management problem is fact that we do not reprocess our spent commercial reactor fuel elements (unlike France, China, Russia, Japan, and India), and thus create more waste than necessary.    Improper waste storage is both a safety hazard and extremely costly to clean up as evident by the Hanford, Washington radioactive [waste leakage](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site). An estimated one million gallons of liquid waste escaped from containers in Hanford, with some entering into the Columbia River. The Department of Energy (DOE) spends about $2-3 billion per year on cleanup efforts at the site, but bioremediation, chemical stabilization, storage transfer, and soil decontamination are expected to take many decades and cost over $110 billion.    The [Nuclear Waste Policy Act](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Waste_Policy_Act) of 1982 intended to establish two commercial waste disposal sites - one in the west and one in the east of the United States (to be determined by DOE) - and formed the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, which instituted the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF), supported largely by spent-fuel fees on waste generators and a 0.1 cent per kw-hour surcharge on nuclear powered electricity. To date, over $44 billion was paid into NWF ($750 million annual revenue) to finance disposal site identification costs and over $10 billion has been spent on this effort.    In 1986, after years of research (considering factors of climate, population density, low regional water table, seismicity, et al.), DOE proposed three potential western area locations for permanent nuclear waste storage: Hanford, WA; Yucca Mountain, NV; and Deaf Smith County, TX. Unsurprisingly, all three states (and Tennessee) protested the nominations. In late 1987, Congress finalized [Yucca Mountain](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository) as the selection. Yucca Mountain was already on federally owned land and partially overlaps the Nevada Test Site (used previously for nuclear weapons testing) in Nye County. Despite millions from the NWF in compensation packages offered to the state for hosting high-level waste disposal, the designation and effort still faces bipartisan opposition.       Yucca Mountain site characterization began in 1986, with the original projection estimating initial construction in 1998 and waste disposal beginning 2003. In reality, the site analysis and DOE’s environmental impact statement wasn’t completed/issued until 2002. DOE filed a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2008 to begin site development, with officials hoping for project completion in 2017. Twenty-seven years later, after many lawsuits, continued opposition from Nevada and environmental groups, and roughly $10 billion spent from when Nuclear Waste Policy Act first began formal efforts to create a permanent disposal system for nuclear waste, the Yucca Mountain project **was ultimately suspended under the Obama administration**. Increased regulatory expectation issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2008 further complicated progress toward disposal site design and execution. Back in 1985, the EPA specified that high-level waste was to be confined in a manner that results in fewer than 1,000 fatalities over 10,000 years, which is the predicted rate with unmined uranium ore; the timetable for isolation is now extended to 1 million years.     With global climate change and pressure to produce more CO2-neutral energy, nuclear power remains an important contributor of global power production (especially for countries with limited access to their own supplies of fossil fuels). Unfortunately, the lingering radioactive byproducts and safety hazards from compromised reactors are externalities for everyone outside of the industry, including those who live in areas not serviced by nuclear power.    I guess, to be fair, no other nation has a permanent storage facility solution established for their nuclear waste either, so it appears that we are all stuck in this radioactive waste management dilemma together… except maybe Finland. The [Onkalo](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository) spent nuclear fuel repository is under construction and anticipated to be operational in 2023 (barring additional setback). The risk of radioactive waste discharge and contamination from impaired permanent containment facilities are also externalities for current and near-future human civilization and whatever mutant race/creatures outlive us. (Hopefully they understand our primitive radioactive warning symbols.)   TL;DR - Nuclear power is a great clean energy source but its growth and adoption is constrained by waste storage.   Good luck to everyone with your investments. I hope we're all rolling in green portfolios and unrealized/realized gains again soon.   Positions: None in nuclear energy (mines, tech, etc)"
LLY,14,15018," When it's all over she's going to be REALLY relieved it was just a silly old stock that made you rich! Lmao there is LITERALLY 0 chance this happens. What a fucking dumb bet. You belong here I guess. Short float when it hit $480 was 143%. It’s at 30% now. DON'T BULLY ME DANIEL DON'T BULLY ME DANIEL! The conditions have changed.     Originally the short positions were ALL under water. As the stock rose, say from $4 - $40, 140% of the float was short. If you were, for instance, 1,000,000 shares short at $4... You now were $40,000,000 upside down.      The HEAVY options activity back in January meant that call writers needed to hedge their risk as the price rose. There was one day it went from $20-$30 (50%) and then $30-$40. As that happened the likihood of those options expiring in the money became more realistic and the call writers needed to go get the shares in the case they had to deliver them to option owners. It literally was a BOMB waiting to explode.      Add in the WSB retail interest, the low float, and you had a catalyst for the stock to ONLY GO UP. Literally. An amazing historical moment in the history of finance.      After the wednesday when the price spiked from $60-$120 we saw a lot of profit taking and a lot of shorting at $120. This crashed the price to $60. This is the first moment that some new shorts entered at $120. Those positions were now healthy at $60.     Despite this, most shorts and most of the shorted float was still REALLY underwater big time. The big shorters were being margin called. As they were margin called they began selling blue-chips and their main holdings to get liquidity, this is why the market dipped big, and some shorters were margin called and liquidated- forced to close their positions.      So then the price went north of $120, now ALL shorters are under water again, and likely some started buying call options to hedge if this thing went up more. This actually exasperated the problem and made it more likely to go up due to call writers hedging.      So add in: 140% short float, margin calls, volatile stock, a lot of call options ITM, retail interest and WSB hype, PLUS big hedge funds were now entering the fun to make money on the squeeze.      POP... Price goes parabolic. Thursday night many shorts were looking at multi-billion dollar losses that they could not pay. The brokers would have had to pay those. So the brokers all decide to stop letting GME be bought. The shorters go to work Friday and sell, sell, sell... They drive the price down to $200 while opening new shorts at $450. Now a lot of shorts are in the green, but they haven't necessarily closed.   &#x200B;  Over the course of the next week people become despondent, fearful, and many sell. This gives shorts that opened at $450 downwards lots of liquidity to close shorts if they want, banking a killing. Those original shorts under $40 MAY have been closed as they were to average out with their other plays that worked. All in all most shorts are now hedged with long and short plays so nothing in particular can kill them. They are no longer cornered.      Since then the price has went UP and DOWN a lot. Every time it goes up it's a new opportunity for new short positions and new long positions. Every time it goes down it's an opportunity for shorts to close and bank profit and new longs to go in. The positions of every player now mean no one is overly compromised or stuck, there are just a lot of players involved with different profit targets. This means we shouldn't see any big margin calls or any forced covering of shares. These guys can wait it out, or they are hedging with their long calls if the price goes crazy stupid up. They are not idiots despite getting in this situation.      So while the GME price might be volatile and it might even get back to $500 the underlying infinite squeeze is no longer possible.      The only real way that the average retail guy can make money now is by being smart with your price entry and your price exit. Have a price target. Do you want to make 10%, 20%, 50%? Have that in mind and start taking profits once you are ahead. All that capital you will make you can use on your next trade.      Good luck to everyone, but do not buy into this situation as the conditions being the same as before- they are SO different... Got some more shares of GME. Traded the van for them straight up.  You know, Lloyd, just when I think you couldn't possibly be any dumber you go and do something like this AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF! Brother. I yolo'd in at $311. I never stopped working my average down. I got it down to 70. And guess what? I bought more at 120. Average is up to 83 now. I just REALLY like the Stonk.  🦍💪💥🚀 Heres the thing. GameStomp is getting so much free advertising from this that they are gonna get cool again. People will associate the store with sticking it to the man for years to come. You literally cant buy that, but if you tried you'd spend hundreds of millions of real dollars with no guarantee of sucess. GME just got that ad campaign for free. I SAY THAT A VALUATION OF $1,000 IS FULLY JUSTIFIED BY THE INCREASE IN GOODWILL ALONE. Thats just science. Very interesting read. What i took from that, is once gme pops off, like REALLY pops off, and its at the point where its time for us to sell, the market will be low enough and we will have the money enough, to invest in more mainstream stocks, and significantly increase the wealth of the working class (most of us i assume) while having the power to impact and influence the entire market in a greater sense than we ever have before. This could change everything if we try. Did this just become bigger than GME??? WAIT IF YOU'RE GONNA ACTUALLY LOOK INTO IT I WAS HIGH LAST NIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY #11 lol the scene is so perfect You are correct but it goes back even further. I remember last April it was a running fucking meme on here that every jobless claims day (Thursday morning for new initial claims numbers I think) stocks would rise EXCEPTIONALLY high Bc it would be like “1 million new claims vs 1.2 million expected!!!!” ... if you plan to make money by asking people when to buy, ESPECIALLY with options you will get killed **First, I am not a financial analyst or am I here to advise on what to do, here to just share my personal insights for discussion/entertainment purposes only. I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
SLV,14,66," Maybe a little bit of both honestly.... I think initially they were on the losing side big time and I’m almost 100% certain that they covered quite a bit when people were unable to purchase shares of conveniently restricted companies on many different platforms and market manipulation was rampant only allowing people to sell and not buy and raising margin requirements forcing positions to be closed and driving the price Down I saw a very similar thing happened in 2011 when Silver and Gold Hit all time highs and they raised margin requirements on SLV AND GLD many times over in order to suppress the price and force people to close positions and it worked That combined with the FEDS quantitative easing and buying mortgage backed securities to keep interest rates low and money cheap encouraging spending to give this false illusion that the economy is fine and running on all cylinders.... Anyway no one can know for certain if the hedge funds have been buying call positions to cover their shorts, I’m almost certain they are,.... however it might not just be the hedge funds that are shorting the stocks any longer I feel like a lot more retail investors also started shorting these stocks just as much as the people who are buying it and one thing is for certain stock can go infinitely higher but it only can go so low, plus with all the exposure all over the Internet and television/news outlets over the past 2 months talking about these meme stocks being a joke they might as well just be encouraging regular retail investors on TV to short these (MEME) companies and capitalize on the retail investor shorting this time while holding and adding to long positions themselves hence possibly screwing over the retail investor in the opposite direction this time.  Again this is all speculation but there’s a lot of short interest still in these stocks and it’s coming from somebody and we can capitalize on it again. I’ll be honest I really feel like a lot of these hedge funds probably closed ALOT BUT NOT ALL SHORT POSITIONS and covered their short positions when many of these brokerages were preventing people from buying and the price dropped like a rock it only makes sense it was a short window for them and I’m almost 100% sure they capitalized on it who is shorting the stocks right now?... Who knows but somebody is and there are a lot of them and when the stocks go up it’s a very bad time for them. Next week should be exciting Invest in T? Is that the new SLV? you'd have to be retarded to buy SLV  banks and hedge funds get away with all sorts of shenanigans, but they were caught openly manipulating the silver market a couple years ago. Not to mention people estimate that there is up to 20x more ""silver"" being traded than there is physical silver.  if you're buying precious metals, buy precious metals, not some horseshit piece of paper Lmao when SLV came in a died 😂😂 SLV not squozable I laughed with that SLV Love the SLV part! so true!!! Did anyone actually fall for the $SLV fake news/bot push? I love that SSLV is in there, nice try hedge funds. LOL Haha that fucking SLV. Then goes back to get more GME. True art! $1400/$PSLV = More shares of silver; $1400/$AG = more silver Your mention of loaning crazy DTI ratios in 2008 paralells the nearly 10 fold increase we've seen in GME shorting fees over the past week. It would seem that if your borrowing costs rose 10 fold you'd move to other investments... but we are seeing nearly the opposite.   My other scattered thoughts are below, curious to know what you think.   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In my opinion we do not currently have accurate short interest numbers, and perhaps never did considering all the potential ways to disguise it. As soon as hedgies knew we relied on that number, it ceased to become a reliable metric.   We all saw Melvin Capital lie about closing their positions pre-squeeze, we all saw CNBC try to divert us with SLV, and we all heard the IB president said if more of those calls were exercised on the 27th/28th it would've crashed everything. We didn't see short fees this high back then, nor did we see no available shares to short like we did on the 25th.  If this blows up we all know the effects it could have on the greater system, and for this reason hedgies are doubling down. In their mind they win both ways, either profiting off shorts by manipulating us all to sell, or getting bailed out by the govt if it all blows up.  Looking at upcoming option contracts: every single expiry has more puts than calls (OI).   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.  Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.  &#x200B;  Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. They tried this last week and failed, and the fight must continue if the squeeze is to be squoze. So, SLV about to make a comeback? 🤣🤣🤣 Buying PHYSICAL silver is completely different than buying SLV.  Physical silver is going to shoot up in price due to shortages, it’s just extremely hard to find a reliable and reputable silver dealer"

APE LIKE VERY MUCH This went on longer than the big dip. And it was worth EVERY FUCKING SECOND. Jesus man, do you ever sleep?  You’ve been making a negative AMC post EVERY hour for the past two days.  How much are you getting paid?  Just curious. All I know is that my portfolio balance stayed relatively untouched over the last week.  I had two friends doing some VERY heavy lifting. And I will thank them by burning them alive to send a message. On the VERY small chance they did block selling, I imagine that would be more down to the brokerages themselves and their middlemen who are unwilling to allow us to have a claim to those astronomical prices because they don't want to/can't handle that amount. They blocked buying because apparently it was too risky for them/us to keep it open. Now while that might be complete bullshit, and obviously it would work differently in the event of a sell-block, I again, just wanted to raise the point and start a conversation about it. Is it possible, and if so, how would it affect us if implemented? Again, although there is a very strong correlation that doesn't mean they are causing one another. There is a possibility of a third variable causing both to rise and fall in a VERY similar way. For example rising interest rates in the US. Also covariance is nothing more than a standardized correlation, it has nothing to do with direction. BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS.""

Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.  This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).  It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.  There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.  AMC has A LOT MORE: [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.  BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.  NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.  Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).  Everyone have a great weekend.  Disclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only. Do your own research. Not financial advice. Eat crayons.     EDIT 2: fucked formatting **TL;DR RKT is going to bull run all the way to the 9th March after its beautiful earnings and it's time to burn some shorts.**  Yesterday pre-earnings I posted some [DD](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsdpuz/rkt_to_the_moon_dd_and_short_squeeze_opportunity/) on why RKT (Rocket Companies) was a buy. I was right, the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10% from highs of a 20% gain during the day. To someone that has not followed RKT this may seem like a missed opportunity. WRONG. Welcome to the Amazon of the Finance World (well near enough).  Rocket by all traditional measures should've risen to $25 (previous close of $19.90) minimum today. Their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past. Practically since the IPO institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls, some covered, some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between $19 and $21 or to average down from a bag holding position above. These players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase (a potential gamma squeeze if it did so). Hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below $22.  **Next week, things start to change...**  But before that let's just go over the insane earnings they just report:  1. **EPS $1.09** (analyst prediction $0.87) an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from $754 million to $2.84 billion. 2. A **special dividend of $1.11** per share to Class A common stock holders on March 9th (note this is important autists). 3. **Partnerships with a multitude of companies including JP Morgan**. 4. Stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended. 5. There's more little nuggets but that's enough for ape brain to take in.  **So what happens next week?**  Firstly the dividend at current stock price is just over **5% yield**. An insane amount. This provides a catalyst for the price in two ways. Firstly, who doesn't want any easy 5% return? This is hardly priced in let's be realistic. These earnings give RKT as **PE of 5**. Way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around **3 to 4 times too small** if you consider them a Fintech.  More importantly, let's have a look at RKT's **short interest**. It lies somewhere between 35% and 40%. Now let's be clear this isn't going to be a Reddit, retail investor driven **short squeeze**, RKT has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million BUT if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure. Shorts have to pay the dividend - an instant 5% loss is not a good look and who knows if there'll be more to come in later earnings. With call holders less in the equation, the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies. It's time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the IPO.  Everyone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover, and 40% of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me. A huge difference between RKT and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above $30 indefinitely (or higher). Shorts don't like to be stuck indefinitely losing, unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse - not that they will unless you all have weak hands. Expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around $30+ to drive the price up more.  With all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of March. I have a genuine PT after that earnings of $40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ship's favour the moon is only the beginning. This Rocket is going up Uranus like your wife's boyfriend's is up hers.  Rocket is recruiting diamond hands, I am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10% profit BUT autists and apes we can get 100%, 200% or more!  RKT closed at $21.85 today. It is my firm believe RKT is a **brilliant buy** after these earnings under $24 and if the bull run starts all the way to $30. Management want these shorts out and that's good enough for me, the CEO laughed at the shorts on CNBC.  I am willing to put my money where my mouth is as I averaged up from $30 per cent equivalent CfD contracts at $20.30 to $41 per cent equivalent at $20.91.  In other words get us to $46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade. These values are actually GBP but I presumed you only know dollar due to autism.  **I just like the stock. So buy shares, squeeze shorts.**  **RKT TO THE MOON!**  [Earnings Call Transcript](https: www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/)  EDIT: VERY IMPORTANT POINT - some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95% is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion not far off GME. Just more reason to buy  Disclaimer: This is not financial advise and should not be taken as such. (SEC scares me)  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/t4b0ga009wj61.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=988cbd4e0b73580ab34b8bdd4fbe20efac64b9af    Grocery Outlet is a boomer bet with overtones of possible insane growth.                            First, the bedrock boomer shit. Grocery outlet buys strategically so they can offer products for 50% to 70% cheaper than the competition., Essentially, they allow my broke ass to eat organic ribeye every night if i so choose.   GO has just 375 locations in 6 states.   Their most recent 10k was released in 2019 and stated they have a longterm potential of 4,800 locations nationwide. GO is just getting started.  Their longterm growth is projected as 14.7% as compared to industries 12.4% in 2019.   They plan to expand their number of locations by at least 10% a year. This alone gets my dong hard.  As stated in their 10k, their management is not accustomed to operating a publicly owned business. This sounds bad, but is actually a good thing imo. GO is already an amazing business model. Imagine if an Ackman/R. Cohen type character came in and bought a huge chunk or the company installed a few heavy hitters to help scale the business.In fact,last week they added Maria Fernanda Meija(former VP Kellogg's) and Gail Moody-byrd(AI marketing analytics at noodle.ai)  to the board.           The above would be enough to get me to invest if i were a boomer, but as a WSB mutant, I need a possibility of a tendie volcano. Now for storytime.  HOW GROCERY OUTLET OFFERS DEEP DISCOUNTS If a store overstocks, a truck gets misdirected, packaging changes, production changes, or any such interruption in the ""Chain of freshness"" occurs, GO capitalizes on this while saving the other company from taking losses.        THE CHAIN OF FRESHNESS  You may have heard that up to a third of all food produced by Americans is thrown away. https: www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/491513/  The Chain of Freshness describes how this happens and how food MOVES. 1. Food is grown  2. Food sent to be processed and/or packaged/branded. 3. It goes to warehouse(this  sometimes involves many layers of regional and local warehouses.) 4. It goes to a store 5.You buy it.  Anywhere during this chain, product can get slowed down. It wont be fresh enough to  be accepted at the next checkpoint in the Chain, so it goes into a dumpster. Although the ""actual freshness"" of the product may be fresher than you would ever see at a store, its not fresh enough to  go to regional, then local distributors before landing at the store not only fresh enough to consume, but fresh enough to be able to sit on the shelf for however long is required by the stores business plan.   This would be a good time to state that im technically an ""industry insider"" as ive been dumpster diving for years. Ive seen warehouse dumpsters full to the top with product all packaged and nice, fresher than you would ever see at a store. You may have heard in the news recently about portland police guarding dumpsters full of food from citizens. Fred Meyer said the food was spoiled, but it was just unsellable due to liability issues and food quality laws. Perfectly edible food. https: apnews.com/article/portland-storms-oregon-4eebd2cd2f1b9f798667994bc871a647  This is just the tip of the iceberg, as warehouse dumpsters are usually behind fences and guarded with cameras so no one sees that waste, except for me. I fill my backpack with organic chocolate, hipflasks of brandy, and have personally recovered enough frozen marinated ribs to grill up and play Meat Jenga with(which we actually did.)  This waste is caused by logistics problems which could be alleviated by Grocery Outlet, adding value to everyone involved                   Now imagine this company if Food Waste Laws are passed, penalizing companies who waste food. With images of cops chasing people away from a dumpster full of perfectly good food in the news, the discussion is very likely to surface among other progressive talking points. Grocery Outlet is uniquely positioned to profit from this trend. If Companies were all of a sudden compelled to reduce their waste, it would be a huge growth opportunity. Just based on their current guidance GO is a great bet. But in this rapidly changing world, a newly public company like GO with an innovative business model can change its current guidance multiple times.  Tldr; a long standing glitch in the logistics of how we sell and move food around leads to dumpsters full of perfectly good food that makes up about a third of all the food Americans produce. GO has a unique business plan that, with the help of a big-dick activist investor,  hiring of corporate heavy hitters, and the Possibility of Food Waste Laws could turn those dumpsters full of food into dumpsters full of money for everyone involved.  Heres a link to an article that has the numbers I referenced. https: finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-grocery-outlet-144102370.html  Positions: All shares, about 10% of my investment capital.

Courtesy of u/brawnerboy  I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https: www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)  If you haven't already, you should read it.  Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.  Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90  &#x200B;  Edit: This is not financial advice I am retarded but I like this stock  Edit: As of 3:15 today the short interest has increased from 38% to 81%"

Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date! ME OMY TO BUY MORE SHARES @ MARKET OPEN Courtesy of u/brawnerboy  I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https: www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)  If you haven't already, you should read it.  Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.  Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90  &#x200B;  Edit: This is not financial advice I am retarded but I like this stock  Edit: As of 3:15 today the short interest has increased from 38% to 81%"

BUY THE FKN DIP BRO BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS.""

IMO,13,137," The only thing I like about the weekend is when the premarket opens on Sunday night.   The rest of those 2 days can go to hell IMO I wouldn't learn here from him, he doesn't understand some of the stuff he is talking about. Not a knock, ppl spew bs all the time, and with this ticker anything seems possible.so I hope he's right for him and everyone listening to him.   You can just buy lotto ticket calls, but generally you don't buy them at a high IV, both puts and calls, because as the IV goes back to it's average the contracts become worth less. Theta gang loves ppl who do this.  The only way I figured this out was ""it can't go tits up"" buying contracts and watching them just get destroyed by theta and IV crush. So maybe get your feet wet with money you're comfortable losing, then when you see how easily you lose money you might get theta gang curious and lurking there and googling for a few months helped me figure out how they work. Always more to learn, tasty trade is pretty great education  resource IMO. Us are ~15% of all shares. IMO this is HF vs HF, and we have more meme power of shares power. A bit of both IMO. You’re paying attention now, but what made you pay attention is that these are crazy times amc is the stupidest play IMO - i would get out of that shit while you are ahead and secure more GME.   The one thing that’s driving me to GME is that it’s constantly inconsistent - the data that’s being reported from everywhere for GME varies, no one knows where the shares are, and Everyone knows something is sus there.   For AMC, it’s light weight, and that boomer CEO on CNBC has no idea what to do with this company but wait until a vaccine rollout, i wouldn’t get distracted. At least if you get fucked in GME the long term looks innovative and not the same old stuff Proof they were a distraction, IMO. I agree but the moves this week was not us IMO AMC shit just seems more suspect by the day imo. It’s like a shit movie, where the clock stops like 1-2 seconds before the bomb goes off, in reference to amc finishing at 8.01, it’s like one big setup to me.  Just trying to distract us from GME IMO. AMC definitely has the best risk/reward ratio IMO!!!AMC TO THE MOON🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍🦍🦍💎💎💎💎 100% agree. The rules of the game would just be changed before anyone gets $100k per share IMO. Not a matter of if it can be afforded, they will not let it happen. That would be a break the glass situation & they would just halt everything. Quality DD IMO SNDL will be making that parabolic moves within a few months....his account gonna be positive again IMO. Heck, it's a great dip buy right now IMO. AMD is by far better than ASML on profit margin IMO"

It was over 25 PM on two different days.  If you used a broker other than Robinhood, you would have been able to sell with huge profits each of those days.  It also hit 20 on the 3rd day and hit like 18 on the 4th day in PM. It was on the 5th day that it tanked in pre-market.  And AMC was primed for a jump almost 2 weeks before the 27th. People were accumulating in the 2.20 range and then it jumped nearly 50% to 3. It accumulated some more at 3, and then it jumped another 50% to 4.50 IT then stayed at 4.50-5.00 for a few days until the AH on Tuesday the 26th when it finally broke out over the 5 resistance and that's when a lot of people started chasing.  It ended AH at \~8. It then hit over 25 in PM the next morning before selling off to 13. It then steadily climbed back to \~!9.90 during the day before having a small sell off going into AH and then another recovery. In PM it went over 23.  And on that day it was primed to go over 30 until the RH, Webull, IBKR and others stopped people from buying causing a massive shift in market sentiment. exactly, for example IBKR does not do margin calls, you will only get a pop up window warning you your liquidity is very low and once it goes negative they start liquidating positions.  I know because..I've been on that end.  Those that do get actual margin calls with time to pay up need to consider themselves lucky I assume as long as it’s in the contract when signing up for the margin account, it’s legal. Robinhood does this. I know because it happened to me a while ago. It’s in the fine print I went back and read it. IBKR does the same thing. The squeeze is going to be way bigger than before. 1. Since according to IBKR and their boss, last spike was only due to gamma, means most of them weren’t even covering at the time. 2.

It will be all over for game stop holders, again, very soon. It's a matter of when, not if, the price will plummet again.

I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

It accumulated some more at 3, and then it jumped another 50% to 4.50 IT then stayed at 4.50-5.00 for a few days until the AH on Tuesday the 26th when it finally broke out over the 5 resistance and that's when a lot of people started chasing.  It ended AH at \~8. It then hit over 25 in PM the next morning before selling off to 13. It then steadily climbed back to \~!9.90 during the day before having a small sell off going into AH and then another recovery. In PM it went over 23.  And on that day it was primed to go over 30 until the RH, Webull, IBKR and others stopped people from buying causing a massive shift in market sentiment. exactly, for example IBKR does not do margin calls, you will only get a pop up window warning you your liquidity is very low and once it goes negative they start liquidating positions.  I know because..I've been on that end.  Those that do get actual margin calls with time to pay up need to consider themselves lucky I assume as long as it’s in the contract when signing up for the margin account, it’s legal. Robinhood does this. I know because it happened to me a while ago. It’s in the fine print I went back and read it. IBKR does the same thing. The squeeze is going to be way bigger than before. 1. Since according to IBKR and their boss, last spike was only due to gamma, means most of them weren’t even covering at the time. 2. Remember that they had to inject 33 MILLION SHARES(MINIMUM) just to keep the price down last Friday, alone that’s 66% SI if you think that they actually covered all that shit last time. (But if you thought that, that begs the question why did the price spike again, and why are they still using every dirty tactic to keep it down below strike prices? I.E. Cramer, short ladders, crying hedgies) 3. Many say that the 50 million volume during the spike was the squeeze but if you believed at least premise 2 which is backed up by data that is being monitored and cannot be avoided by hedgies. Then we had 140% SI at start, got down to 40% SI if they covered at all, and jumped to 106% SI last Friday on their push to <100 TLDR: Hedgies are fucked even in the worst case scenario we are 106% SI still. We ain’t finished yet boys. They could still play the long game and cover before key strike and sell prices are met though. What does that mean??? They know 800 was an important target for us so they might only cover till it jumps to 700. They know 1000 is where a lot of us may start shaving off so they might cut it at 900. 69420 is a popular price they think people will pull out so they pull out at 60-65.  In conclusion: they may think their pullout game is good enough to avoid getting the ass blast of a century, but if that were true, they wouldn’t have gotten buttfucked to begin with. It will be all over for game stop holders, again, very soon. It's a matter of when, not if, the price will plummet again. And yes I know I'm just stating the obvious:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2021/02/27/gamestop-stock-gme-price-rise-is-enticing-but-misleading--dont-get-trapped/?sh=6c0aee3c6337](https: www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2021/02/27/gamestop-stock-gme-price-rise-is-enticing-but-misleading--dont-get-trapped/?sh=6c0aee3c6337)  &#x200B;  BoFA on why it's a 10$ stock.

I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

LEA,12,23771," There is absolutely the possibility we don’t see stimmies for AT LEAST another month. We’re becoming wayyy too reliant on those checks becoming a reality. The market is way more dynamic than what you understand.  There is a very small probability that the options you are trading are from 18 months ago.  Many are from a week or two ago.  Even if someone were to sell a LEAP 18 mths out you don't think some of them bought them back when the price bottomed at $38 a couple weeks ago on GME and reduced the OI.  The volume of the underlying stock is driving incrementally more options sales.  These options are new and the OI is constantly going up and down. Wouldn't surprise me if big money was selling a bunch of naked calls on a big spike and then buying them back on a dip for 20 to 25% profit in minutes or hours.  I sold a bunch of AMC Calls for $17 next Friday when it spiked to over $10.  If I want to I could have already bought them back for 30 to 40% profit and reduce the OI  on my calls.  I am holding because I don't think it will hit and stay above $17 by Friday.  I had some calls I sold last week at $7 that I rolled up to $8 and out a week for a credit.

Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys!

Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date! Chances of seeing $300 again are almost %100 given a year or so time.  Unless Ryan Cohen and friends absolutely shit he bed $300 is an absolute low. Compare Gaming as a whole to pet supplies as a whole. Now compare Chewy’s market cap with GME’s.  Now laugh with me about how silly it is to think that GameStop isn’t worth at LEAST $300/share. Selling PLTR LEAPs Strategy"

Since according to IBKR and their boss, last spike was only due to gamma, means most of them weren’t even covering at the time. 2. Remember that they had to inject 33 MILLION SHARES(MINIMUM) just to keep the price down last Friday, alone that’s 66% SI if you think that they actually covered all that shit last time. (But if you thought that, that begs the question why did the price spike again, and why are they still using every dirty tactic to keep it down below strike prices? I.E. Cramer, short ladders, crying hedgies) 3. Many say that the 50 million volume during the spike was the squeeze but if you believed at least premise 2 which is backed up by data that is being monitored and cannot be avoided by hedgies. Then we had 140% SI at start, got down to 40% SI if they covered at all, and jumped to 106% SI last Friday on their push to <100 TLDR: Hedgies are fucked even in the worst case scenario we are 106% SI still. We ain’t finished yet boys. They could still play the long game and cover before key strike and sell prices are met though. What does that mean??? They know 800 was an important target for us so they might only cover till it jumps to 700. They know 1000 is where a lot of us may start shaving off so they might cut it at 900. 69420 is a popular price they think people will pull out so they pull out at 60-65.  In conclusion: they may think their pullout game is good enough to avoid getting the ass blast of a century, but if that were true, they wouldn’t have gotten buttfucked to begin with.  Edit: Forgot to add 20@ 85. Waiting till 40-70 to reload Someone has to cover. Shares have to come from somewhere. If they don’t buy it themselves, then it goes up chain of command to market makers who wrote the options, To banks, to complete financial collapse. The CEO of IBKR wasn’t lying about a domino Bankrupcy While you are in general correct, many people that sell super OTM calls don't properly hedge. If those calls expire ITM, they are required to buy the shares at whatever price the market sells them before they are obligated to deliver (see the IBKR chairman interview). This is likely what happened Monday 1/25 after a lot of unhedged calls expired ITM on 1/22. Eh it wasn't inconsequential on 1/25, and it was consequential enough that the IBKR chairman halted buying on IBKR for that reason alone (they definitely don't have liquidity issues). That being said, it won't be the driver people here are expecting it to be. The price on 1/25 fell just as fast as it climbed. It won't be enough buying pressure to produce a sustained price increase. But it might be enough buying pressure to make people think something is happening so they buy a bunch of calls, then rinse and repeat late January.  Edit: don't downvote OP here. His reply to me is generally correct. GME is an exception because there have been a lot of retarded call sellers. Yeah well he also said the whole system could have crashed if they didn’t stop buying because there were options for “150M shares” bought and only 50M shares out.  1) I checked. OI on 1/27 and 1/28 totaled 150k and 100K (10M and 15M shares) respectively. Which is a sht ton on a stock with 50M float but it’s not 3x the float 2) GME closed Friday 1/29 at $325 meaning a ton of options were ITM. And yet... here we still are. Did GME get massively squeezed the next week? No. Did the financial system crumble? No.  So what he said makes no sense. I get that he’s the founder of IBKR and worth $20B and I’m an idiot on Reddit but the way everyone bought his explanation is wild. Anyone stop to consider he had an interest in over exaggerating the situation to explain why IKBr couldn’t meet collateral requirements? It was over 25 PM on two different days.  If you used a broker other than Robinhood, you would have been able to sell with huge profits each of those days.  It also hit 20 on the 3rd day and hit like 18 on the 4th day in PM. It was on the 5th day that it tanked in pre-market.  And AMC was primed for a jump almost 2 weeks before the 27th. People were accumulating in the 2.20 range and then it jumped nearly 50% to 3. It accumulated some more at 3, and then it jumped another 50% to 4.50 IT then stayed at 4.50-5.00 for a few days until the AH on Tuesday the 26th when it finally broke out over the 5 resistance and that's when a lot of people started chasing.  It ended AH at \~8. It then hit over 25 in PM the next morning before selling off to 13. It then steadily climbed back to \~!9.90 during the day before having a small sell off going into AH and then another recovery. In PM it went over 23.  And on that day it was primed to go over 30 until the RH, Webull, IBKR and others stopped people from buying causing a massive shift in market sentiment. exactly, for example IBKR does not do margin calls, you will only get a pop up window warning you your liquidity is very low and once it goes negative they start liquidating positions.  I know because..I've been on that end.  Those that do get actual margin calls with time to pay up need to consider themselves lucky I assume as long as it’s in the contract when signing up for the margin account, it’s legal. Robinhood does this. I know because it happened to me a while ago. It’s in the fine print I went back and read it. IBKR does the same thing. The squeeze is going to be way bigger than before. 1. Since according to IBKR and their boss, last spike was only due to gamma, means most of them weren’t even covering at the time. 2. Remember that they had to inject 33 MILLION SHARES(MINIMUM) just to keep the price down last Friday, alone that’s 66% SI if you think that they actually covered all that shit last time. (But if you thought that, that begs the question why did the price spike again, and why are they still using every dirty tactic to keep it down below strike prices? I.E. Cramer, short ladders, crying hedgies) 3. Many say that the 50 million volume during the spike was the squeeze but if you believed at least premise 2 which is backed up by data that is being monitored and cannot be avoided by hedgies. Then we had 140% SI at start, got down to 40% SI if they covered at all, and jumped to 106% SI last Friday on their push to <100 TLDR: Hedgies are fucked even in the worst case scenario we are 106% SI still. We ain’t finished yet boys. They could still play the long game and cover before key strike and sell prices are met though. What does that mean??? They know 800 was an important target for us so they might only cover till it jumps to 700. They know 1000 is where a lot of us may start shaving off so they might cut it at 900. 69420 is a popular price they think people will pull out so they pull out at 60-65.  In conclusion: they may think their pullout game is good enough to avoid getting the ass blast of a century, but if that were true, they wouldn’t have gotten buttfucked to begin with. It will be all over for game stop holders, again, very soon. It's a matter of when, not if, the price will plummet again. And yes I know I'm just stating the obvious:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2021/02/27/gamestop-stock-gme-price-rise-is-enticing-but-misleading--dont-get-trapped/?sh=6c0aee3c6337](https: www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2021/02/27/gamestop-stock-gme-price-rise-is-enticing-but-misleading--dont-get-trapped/?sh=6c0aee3c6337)  &#x200B;  BoFA on why it's a 10$ stock.

I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

SOME WILL SELL AND SOME WILL BUY   WILL YOUR DIAMOND HANDS START TO PRUNE?  THE SQUEEZE OF THE HEDGIES   WILL ROCKET US TO THE MOON! That is Autistapemanoid freakin DIAMONDS!!!!! I woke up 5am today, because I was knocked out at 830 last night and writing to you guys now. Why is that relevant? Because I'm also one of the dumb apes in on this, reading reddit daily since the Jan 29th debacle. I decided to write this for many reasons, read if yall want. One of the reasons is I don't or can't talk to anyone right now about Gme for obvious reasons. ""sell that shit, the volume doesn't look right, well TV said this bla bla bla""   JUST FUCKING DIAMOND HANDS. Jesus christ buddha  No proof or DD just opinions.   1. First things first, what people have to realize is our society is based on and run on profits. (more so in America) Financial, health, food, education industry, all them big dogs 1% etc want profits.   2. Now that you know that, they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make said profits. Some stay in the straight and narrow, the rest is that 1%. I get it, you want to make money, everyone does. So they find ways to evade tax, pay off people, make friends with higher-ups coughgovernmentofficials. This is all theory. Take it as you will.   3. I explain 1 and 2 because it leads me to 3. Jan 28th or 29th or whatever, all I needed to read was some hf was suspicious of ""making things up to profit"" and unfortunately got caught by Mr dfv.   4. 1 2 and 3 is what leads me to believe at that point that the squeeze is real. I read absolutely no DD and know nothing about stocks, and never read anything on wsb because I don't bet on what I can't win. I opened up Fidelity account cuz you know. RH. That was the other thing that set me off. RH, read 1 and 2.  Below are just rants now.   5. The squeeze is real. Read 1 & 2 & 3  6. You ain't diamond hands unless you read like 20 DDs minimum a day. To be a diamond hand, don't worry about shills and all those short ladder attack, Silver, open court cases, short interests reports, dips, tweets etc, because read 1, 2 and 3. That's all you need to care about.   7. The more I read DDs since early February, the more I bought in, like 3 times actually.   8. To me in the beginning, this was not an investment but a BET. Hence wsB. But the bet payout was this:  A. In the beginning my head was, spend 10 dollars, you get 3 outcomes. You only lose maybe 1 to 3 dollars Max, if you bought low like 40 to 60 maybe. Ok we lose SOME money, just don't eat out next time or work an extra week or something for those of us fortunate to do so. Remember this is a BET. don't use what you can't afford.   B. You break even and get your money back, GME ain't going bankrupt ever, read the DDs, Ryan Cohen and crew. Also read 1 2 and 3, it's in media now.   C. With 10 dollars you make $1000 right? Win win? Nah dog, this payout is going to be 100k share +. Again read 1, 2 and 3. And now this went from a BET to an investment. Why? Because I don't bet what I can't win. I'm cheap like that.   9. Now people are day trading. To me it's like buying a 20 dollar scratch ticket to win 40 dollars. Then betting and buying more scratch ticket hoping you win, yall gonna sell and miss the squeeze guys, read 1 2 and 3 HODL. OR you can buy a 1 dollar scratch ticket, HODL for a rainy day and win 100k or more, multiplier of other apes holding too.  10. This is a once and lifetime opportunity. It's like going on let's make a deal TV show. You take the $2000 cash instead of picking what's behind curtain 1 2 and 3. Where in this case the curtain is certainly going to have alot more money and there's literally no zonks. Why? Read 1 2 and 3, that's why yall should HODL.   This is a roller-coaster of a ride. It went from me wanting to screw hedge funds over to me paying off my cc debts, to me paying off my house to me retiring, to me now wanting to do philanthropy and open businesses to help the regular folk and change peoples lives. But you can't do that shit with 10k a share or even 100k a share. It needs  fuck you money. Let's ALL make fuck you money guys. Apes strong, thanks for listening. I have no one to share this ride with. Please don't block me. Good luck guys, stay safe. Get some fucking sleep and stop reading reddit so much and just watch the ticker, cuz it's going to blast off as long as we hold. Why? Read 1, 2 and 3.  This is not financial advice etc. Just observation and personal opinions. Im pretty sure there's real data out there from those conspiracy heads but I'm too lazy to prove it and you know, read #2. This could all also blow over and we make no profit and doesn't blast off cuz why? Read #2.  TLDR: companies caught with pants down doing shady things for profit. We found out, it's an opportunity for a squeeze. All you need to know is these guys will do whatever it takes to get away with it. Hold, don't sell low, no need to day trade, wait for the squeeze, and we all make fuck you money. Everything else isn't worth reading or worrying about. God speed.   Edit: forgot TLDR: FUCK THEM. WE MAY HOLD BAGS BUT THEY ARE FULL OF DIAMONDS DONT UNDERESTIMATE US! DIAMOND HANDS FOR LIFE! *Contains Real Steel Movie Spoilers*"

It's as simple as this:  Are we shorting a stock by a ridiculously insane amount?  If yes, it could be a GameStop situation.  Are we selling a ridiculously insane amount of naked calls on a stock?  If yes, it could be a GameStop situation.  Are both of these situations occurring on the same stock?  If yes, it is DEFINITELY going to be a GameStop situation.  You don't even need to go to reddit to get answers for that... I was disappointed Michael Jai White wasn't Marvel's choice for Black Panther. He was great in Spawn and ABSOLUTELY amazing as Black Dynamite. I figured ""He's got to be Blade, right?"" Oh well. Wow you got HUGELY brigaded   It is absolutely on the money as well.  Guys, do the basic level of DD on each business and compare them.  GME is totally different from AMC. Just because ignorant points of view make them LOOK the same, they are seriously **seriously** not the same. Your mention of loaning crazy DTI ratios in 2008 paralells the nearly 10 fold increase we've seen in GME shorting fees over the past week. It would seem that if your borrowing costs rose 10 fold you'd move to other investments... but we are seeing nearly the opposite.   My other scattered thoughts are below, curious to know what you think.   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In my opinion we do not currently have accurate short interest numbers, and perhaps never did considering all the potential ways to disguise it. As soon as hedgies knew we relied on that number, it ceased to become a reliable metric.   We all saw Melvin Capital lie about closing their positions pre-squeeze, we all saw CNBC try to divert us with SLV, and we all heard the IB president said if more of those calls were exercised on the 27th/28th it would've crashed everything. We didn't see short fees this high back then, nor did we see no available shares to short like we did on the 25th.  If this blows up we all know the effects it could have on the greater system, and for this reason hedgies are doubling down. In their mind they win both ways, either profiting off shorts by manipulating us all to sell, or getting bailed out by the govt if it all blows up.  Looking at upcoming option contracts: every single expiry has more puts than calls (OI).   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.  Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.  &#x200B;  Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. They tried this last week and failed, and the fight must continue if the squeeze is to be squoze. To start off with, I have to say that this post is not intended to spread FUD or to discourage people. This is a post to help us “plan for the worst and hope for the best”. It is to open a discussion with people more knowledgeable than myself who can help clear up some of these issues.  &#x200B;  While commenting on another post I started to realise some of the ways the hedge funds could try and climb out of this hole they have dug, or at least screw us over in the process of a squeeze. I have not seen these points being discussed nor do I know of any solid reasons why they couldn’t happen.  There is evidence that the shorts have already used illegal actions to supress the price and delay a full squeeze on GameStop. I cannot comment on whether they DEFINITELY committed any crimes, but in the interest of risk management I think we all need to presume they have done, and will do again.  You see, when an organisation has as much money as some of these hedge funds, they have power as well. Real power. Most people would presume the age of the 1% getting away with everything has passed, but it has just become more subtle. As the world saw in 2008, these people can and do get away with their crimes, even if it destroys entire economies.  Anyway, to get to the point, I have been thinking about multiple ways the shorts can and possibly will try and save themselves, or at least stop us from seeing the full potential of the squeeze.  \[Note: Some of these points are aimed directly at brokerages, but with the possibility that hedge funds may have pulled strings to manipulate the brokers in mind. i.e., Actions of brokerages that directly benefit the short sellers.\]  \[Note 2: This whole post is to be taken as a question of sorts. I am not stating facts, merely presenting problems. If anyone actually knows the definitive answer or likelihood to any of these problems then please comment.\]  &#x200B;  * **Brokerages block the ‘sell’ option.**  Considering our problem last time was them blocking buys, this might not immediately seem like such a bad thing, because that would mean the price would only go up, right?  Stopping further short selling would benefit us as the price couldn’t be supressed as much, but stopping us from selling would just mean the price would go up, and we’d be left watching as we are unable to ever sell. As much as I am willing to hold forever if I have to, we are all hoping for it to reach such a price where we would sell eventually.  But wouldn’t this be illegal? Would it? I thought that blocking buys would be illegal but apparently not. If they can block the buys they can probably block the sells as well – they bury a lot of manipulative and controlling stuff in their terms and conditions. If anyone with a greater understanding of the law knows about the legality of restricting selling could let us know then that would be helpful.  &#x200B;  * **Brokerages allow people to sell at extreme profits, but refuse to pay the astronomical prices.**  This is one that definitely **should** be illegal, and something even the most untouchable couldn’t get away with. With that said, I don’t feel comfortable resting everything on a ‘should’. Whether you think it at all possible or not, imagine if the massive target of $30million per share actually happens. Can you really see all these brokerages just coughing up straight away without any fuss?  Or, is it at all possible that they could yet again hide behind legal loopholes and fine print to refrain from paying us those amounts? “There is a maximum amount you can have in your account at one time”, “This is over the maximum amount of money we can handle in a transaction”, “Due to the extreme volatility of this stock, sell order could not be processed, the number you are seeing on screen is incorrect and will be removed from your account. Do not try to withdraw any of this money.” The list goes on.  I especially want to make it clear here that I am asking if any of this is possible. I am a bit of an idiot but I think a discussion is worth having on these matters, because as far as I am concerned, everything is on the table and nothing is too farfetched.  &#x200B;  * **Brokerages artificially fake outages and failures, blocking people from using their services and pretending they were just overwhelmed with the extreme, sudden increase in volume of users again.**  How do we know they haven’t already done this? They can stop people from trading freely while blaming technology and even the large amount of people using their service.  &#x200B;  * **Hedge funds digitally attacking brokerages to cut off a large chunk of retail investors and lock them out of the squeeze.**  Is it possible the hedge funds could pay others to attack the brokerages digitally, whether through something like a DDoS attack or other methods? I imagine they would especially target the large no-commission brokers like Robinhood and T212.  It also seems to me like it would be a difficult crime to trace back to the hedge funds, and I actually see very little reason why hedge funds wouldn’t be able to do this. With the amount of money the hedgies are set to lose, they are going to be desperate and willing to resort to desperate measures. If this did happen and we were unable to sell then would we be entitled to compensation?  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  # THE BIG ONE.  **\[Update:** I have had numerous people commenting with good explanations of the following point. I am now considering 'THE BIG ONE' not so big anymore, and thank you all for your input.\]  If the main shorts responsible for all of this go bankrupt before they are able to buy back every single share they’d have to, what would happen then?  If the numbers people are estimating are even close to the true possible number then I would say it’s very likely they’d go bankrupt very quickly. It is my understanding that most debts of sorts are written off when a company or organisation files for bankruptcy, which is the main reason some people force their own companies into bankruptcy only the re-launch with a different name and no debt.  If we really do destroy the hedge funds that are behind the majority of the short positions, then do we destroy ourselves in the process? I can’t see them being forces to pay up billions upon billions in debt if they are bankrupt, because they would never reasonably obtain that money. In that case, who is going to pay?  My best guess is that in one the worst case scenarios the price skyrockets as they cover as much as they can and then it just stops when they run out of money. No one else is going to voluntarily buy those shares at those prices so wouldn’t we end up with GME stalling at an insane price but with no one able to sell and no one able to buy, meaning the share price would just… stop?  If that did happen then I can’t see the SEC or the US Government (simply because it’s a US stock) doing nothing as for the first time a stock get’s infinitely stuck. Therefore, would they then artificially lower the price to get people buying again? This would mean none of us could actually sell at the price it reaches.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  If you even made it this far you are all probably pissed off at me for saying it over and over, but I am NOT claiming any of this will happen. The last thing I want to do is unintentionally spread FUD. I’m presuming some will call me a shill anyway for even bringing these points up but I need to clarify that I am invested in GME and I am confident that it will squeeze at some point. I am 100% in this cause, and I don’t believe this is any reason for people to worry or be demotivated.  With that said, I am not so naïve as to presume this will all go perfectly for us with no obstacles – just look at last time when they stopped us from buying and killed the upwards momentum. We need to be as best prepared as we can, and ideally we need a legal ‘mutually assured destruction’ to dissuade anything I have mentioned here.  What I am asking for is for people to PLEASE prove me wrong. If any of you have a greater knowledge of the law or the inner workings of things then please comment and let us all know.  &#x200B;  Thank you to anyone who may be able to help. Im just saying: I WILL COMPLETELY SHORT THE STOCK WITH MY WHOLE AVAILABLE MONEY. Don’t care about what you’re doing. But that’s my plan. No financial advice. As expected of a 1mon old account, this is complete bs. Sorry to pop your bubble, but it is EXTREMELY UNLIKELY that Melvin will run out of cash to leverage their shorts. You've seen yourself the manipulation; if they hedged every high and low they would never run out of capital, not to mention their sold calls that expired OTM. The squeeze will also never reach a point so as to bankrupt Melvin, because the SEC will step in to prevent a massive degrossings. Plus, Melvin rolled up their shorts to the hundreds, maybe even 400, so if you use the same ratio as before, GME would need to reach >5000$ to make them bankrupt. If it even gets close to that, we'll see the same closings of brokerages, media attacks, etc all enacted by the SEC. Call volume is not a useful indicator, it just means a lot of call OI is changing hands back and forth. Next week has put OI of 87,259 and call OI of 65,041.   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.   Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.   Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. If this was before the move up then they have entered a back spread and it would imply the hedge funds are EXTREMELY bullish on the stock. In other words, literally everyone in the world including Melvin and Citadel thinks GME will go to the moon and the price action in the past month is a bunch of none sense.  Hope you realise how ridiculous it sounds.   More likely case is that youtube dude didn’t know that “hedge funds” don’t actually hedge their bets. Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date! Check out the physical deliveries from the comex last month. 45 Million ounces. This is real, it's not a ploy. It's the one money government does not know you have.  Also PM producers like AG and AEM are EXTREMELY  leveraged. PM prices go up 10% they are up 30-40%."
TDA,12,73," I noticed this on TDA mobile app as well on Thursday and Friday. The orders would disappear whether it be a buy to sell. I’d have to refresh multiple times for the open orders page to be accurate again. I checked to see if an order got filled but it wasn’t in the open or filled section. I placed the order again...  I checked my positions and the order was filled. Afterwards, I checked my open orders and the second order I placed was still open.   It was not cool. If they go bankrupt, so is TDA.  They merged and are one company temporarily running 2 platforms.  And TD closed offices and cut staff a while back.  If you have a sizable account, the generally give you a dedicated advisor, even if you handle your own account. Isn't TDA buying Schwab or something? I had double buy for NAK on TDA, I was pissed until I made 23k off of it the next week.  I'll pray for you. On WednesdayTDA wouldnt let me buy any shares of AMC My info was from 2/15 on TDA. I don’t know how to post pics. Thankfully i transferred all my shit to TDA It starts from TDA. I already had an account with them thankfully. I applied to transfer from TDA on Friday, and everything was in my account the following Thursday. i think fidelity is what most here would recommend. i went with TDA You can also set a sell limit order which means they can’t use your stock to cover shorts. You just have to keep an eye on it so that you don’t accidentally sell your stock. TDA only allows the limit to be 150% of the current stock price, and with volatility, you can make a mistake if you aren’t able to watch the price change closely. Positions: 2 gme @ 269 and 10 amc @ 15 🦍🚀🌜 This analysis looks at one possible break-up scenario of the Rite Aid corporation that projects a return of more than 2.5X the closing share price of $19.58 on Friday, February 26, 2021.  Rite Aid (RAD) consists of two (2) parts:  1. The Retail Pharmacy business currently generating approximately $16 billion in annual revenues. 2. The Prescription Benefits Management (PBM) services business known as ELIXIR, currently generating approximately $8 billion in annual revenues.  One possible scenario for unlocking the value of RAD involves the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business and Rite Aid brand.  What is left is the ELIXIR PBM organization.  Here is an estimation of how such an approach might play out:  * In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash.  That represents an average price of $2.275 million per store. * Should RAD seek a buyer for its Retail Pharmacy business, it could sell its 2,450 remaining stores as well as the Rite Aid brand.  Despite the fact that many of these stores are located in highly attractive locations (CA, OH, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, VA, etc), let's discount the average value of each store by 20% (compared to the average price-per-store paid by Walgreens), and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $1.8 million per store. * At a average price of $1.8 million per store, RAD could reasonably generate proceeds of $4.4 billion with the sale of the entire Retail Pharmacy business, including the 2,450 locations and the Rite Aid brand name (assigning no good will value to the brand). * The remaining RAD organization essentially consists of a PBM branded as ELIXIR and a net amount of cash on hand of +$1.2 billion, assuming that $3.2 billion of the Retail Pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing long-term debt on the company's books. * ELIXIR's projected sales for RAD's fiscal year 2021 (ending February 2021) are approximately $8 billion.  During each of the past four (4) quarters, RAD has reported ELIXIR's year-over-year growth rate to be in the range of  23 - 29%. * ELIXIR's projected EBITDA for fiscal 2022 (begining March of 2021) will likely be approximately $200 million.  Once again, I am taking a conservative estimate, and basically considering that a business that has grown 23 - 29% each quarter for the past year, will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year. * With only 55,000,000 shares outstanding today, the $200 million EBITDA generated by ELIXIR translates to roughly $3.60 per share in earnings.  Using a highly conservative PE multiple of 8, a stock price of $28.80 results.   However, the cash-on-hand of $1.2 billion (from the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business after long-term debt payoff) produces additional value of $22.00 per share, resulted in a stock price value of more than $50 per share (which is more than 2.5X the closing price of $19.58 on Friday, February 26, 2021). * The newly created company, ELIXIR, would be well-positioned for growth in the small-to-mid-size opportunity segment of the $400 billion per year PBM industry.  With a net $1.2 billion in cash, that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition.  In conclusion, this analysis indicates that the conservative value of RAD today is $50 per share, well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market, which is just under $20.  The purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the Rite Aid corporation is the best strategic path forward.  (I personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $100 in the next 12 - 24 months if it keeps the entire organization fully in tact.)  Rather, the purpose of the post was to reveal the hidden value locked within RAD that is clearly being overlooked by the investment community, by analyzing one possible break-up scenario. Vlad is just another fuck CEO. Switched over to TDA."

LET ME SEE THOSE FCKING PUTS BICHES, I THOT THIS SUB WAS ABOUT US LOSING MONEY??? DONT YOU WANT ME TO BE POORER THAN I ALREADY AM??? LETS SEE THOSE FCKING PUTS THEN YOU DIRTY LIMP DICK FCKS I loved how just last week (before the spike of course), we had some members of the WSB community making fun of $GME ""bagholders"" and telling us to ""let it go already"".  Well....IF YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE FOLKS FUCK YOU BECAUSE $GME & $AMC HODLERS ARE ON A ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON AND YOU'RE NOT INVITED SO GO SHILL SOMEWHERE ELSE. These mothafuckers shorted more shares than we bought???   YALL KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE TAX RETURNS ON MONDAY  Not my cat advise. I'm not a stock. I love the moon Some of you may know that AMCX spiked on Friday. There's many that believe it was from lost Apes buying the wrong ticker. But it could have been because of the upbeat earnings call they had prior to market open.  Is anyone thinking of putting in a short or options play against this sudden spike?  Seems like an appropriate play to talk about in the bets forum because of the risk involved. If its played short because a bunch of people bought the wrong ticker then great, puts and shorts will print.  BUT... If it spiked in legit fashion from the earnings call rather than way ward Apes buying the wrong stock.... well, that's a lot of premium and buyback to gobble up the bank account.  I know everyone just upvotes memes and 🦍🧠💎✋🚀🚀🚀🍌 but every once in a while its fun to get quasi cerebral.      Show me your thoughts and/or THOTS ?"
ALLY,11,14988," When it's all over she's going to be REALLY relieved it was just a silly old stock that made you rich! Lmao there is LITERALLY 0 chance this happens. What a fucking dumb bet. You belong here I guess. Short float when it hit $480 was 143%. It’s at 30% now. The conditions have changed.     Originally the short positions were ALL under water. As the stock rose, say from $4 - $40, 140% of the float was short. If you were, for instance, 1,000,000 shares short at $4... You now were $40,000,000 upside down.      The HEAVY options activity back in January meant that call writers needed to hedge their risk as the price rose. There was one day it went from $20-$30 (50%) and then $30-$40. As that happened the likihood of those options expiring in the money became more realistic and the call writers needed to go get the shares in the case they had to deliver them to option owners. It literally was a BOMB waiting to explode.      Add in the WSB retail interest, the low float, and you had a catalyst for the stock to ONLY GO UP. Literally. An amazing historical moment in the history of finance.      After the wednesday when the price spiked from $60-$120 we saw a lot of profit taking and a lot of shorting at $120. This crashed the price to $60. This is the first moment that some new shorts entered at $120. Those positions were now healthy at $60.     Despite this, most shorts and most of the shorted float was still REALLY underwater big time. The big shorters were being margin called. As they were margin called they began selling blue-chips and their main holdings to get liquidity, this is why the market dipped big, and some shorters were margin called and liquidated- forced to close their positions.      So then the price went north of $120, now ALL shorters are under water again, and likely some started buying call options to hedge if this thing went up more. This actually exasperated the problem and made it more likely to go up due to call writers hedging.      So add in: 140% short float, margin calls, volatile stock, a lot of call options ITM, retail interest and WSB hype, PLUS big hedge funds were now entering the fun to make money on the squeeze.      POP... Price goes parabolic. Thursday night many shorts were looking at multi-billion dollar losses that they could not pay. The brokers would have had to pay those. So the brokers all decide to stop letting GME be bought. The shorters go to work Friday and sell, sell, sell... They drive the price down to $200 while opening new shorts at $450. Now a lot of shorts are in the green, but they haven't necessarily closed.   &#x200B;  Over the course of the next week people become despondent, fearful, and many sell. This gives shorts that opened at $450 downwards lots of liquidity to close shorts if they want, banking a killing. Those original shorts under $40 MAY have been closed as they were to average out with their other plays that worked. All in all most shorts are now hedged with long and short plays so nothing in particular can kill them. They are no longer cornered.      Since then the price has went UP and DOWN a lot. Every time it goes up it's a new opportunity for new short positions and new long positions. Every time it goes down it's an opportunity for shorts to close and bank profit and new longs to go in. The positions of every player now mean no one is overly compromised or stuck, there are just a lot of players involved with different profit targets. This means we shouldn't see any big margin calls or any forced covering of shares. These guys can wait it out, or they are hedging with their long calls if the price goes crazy stupid up. They are not idiots despite getting in this situation.      So while the GME price might be volatile and it might even get back to $500 the underlying infinite squeeze is no longer possible.      The only real way that the average retail guy can make money now is by being smart with your price entry and your price exit. Have a price target. Do you want to make 10%, 20%, 50%? Have that in mind and start taking profits once you are ahead. All that capital you will make you can use on your next trade.      Good luck to everyone, but do not buy into this situation as the conditions being the same as before- they are SO different... Got some more shares of GME. Traded the van for them straight up.  You know, Lloyd, just when I think you couldn't possibly be any dumber you go and do something like this AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF! Brother. I yolo'd in at $311. I never stopped working my average down. I got it down to 70. And guess what? I bought more at 120. Average is up to 83 now. I just REALLY like the Stonk.  🦍💪💥🚀 Very interesting read. What i took from that, is once gme pops off, like REALLY pops off, and its at the point where its time for us to sell, the market will be low enough and we will have the money enough, to invest in more mainstream stocks, and significantly increase the wealth of the working class (most of us i assume) while having the power to impact and influence the entire market in a greater sense than we ever have before. This could change everything if we try. Did this just become bigger than GME??? WAIT IF YOU'RE GONNA ACTUALLY LOOK INTO IT I WAS HIGH LAST NIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY #11 lol the scene is so perfect You are correct but it goes back even further. I remember last April it was a running fucking meme on here that every jobless claims day (Thursday morning for new initial claims numbers I think) stocks would rise EXCEPTIONALLY high Bc it would be like “1 million new claims vs 1.2 million expected!!!!” ... if you plan to make money by asking people when to buy, ESPECIALLY with options you will get killed **First, I am not a financial analyst or am I here to advise on what to do, here to just share my personal insights for discussion/entertainment purposes only. I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.  Do your own diligence, do not message me on what to do or not to do, hate or love me, I am just sharing it here since I got banned on other subreddit for mentioning a digital currency couple of times in a row, lol.  **To end, I believe this company is undervalued, shorted, earning transcript showed me they are bound to comeback, good for short term small gains and long-term big gains.**  EDIT2: Obligatory rockets for people that cannot read   **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Sources (too lazy to copy links):  Finviz, Yahoo Finance, Gurufocus, ROOTs website, opinions/posts of analysts back in November and one in December. Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
CFO,11,3041," Thank the CFO who got fired ￼≡  Redditors, Ryan Cohen Needs Your Help to Send GME Stock Back to $500  2/26/2021 1:32pm EST  By Thomas Yeung, CFA, InvestorPlace Markets Analyst  In 2015, the Financial Times joked that RadioShack, an ailing brick-and-mortar electronics chain, should consider selling fruit baskets or turning its stores into Zumba studios to survive. The retailer had ignored the threat of e-commerce for so long that few believed it could survive. Two years later, RadioShack was virtually no more.  ￼￼  Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com  Today, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock sits at a similar juncture. Since the early 2010s, GME’s top brass had treated the retailer like drunks at an open bar — doling out a princely dividend to shareholders (and stock options to themselves) while cutting reinvestment into aging stores. But then something happened: A group of retail investors, driven by Reddit’s hedge-fund-hatin’ r/WallStreetBets decided to take GME stock from $10 to $480 in a matter of weeks. The people still love GameStop! This love for GameStop and disdain for Wall Street is an unusual combo. It means that, unlike RadioShack in 2015, the video game retailer still has a fighting chance. For the good of GameStop and its shareholders, Reddit investors need to finish the revolution they started. And if they do, Redditors and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) founder Ryan Cohen can still send GME stock back to $500.  GME Stock: Intentionally Driven into a Ditch  Anyone who’s recently visited a GameStop store will tell you the same thing: They look old. And that’s by design. For over a decade, GameStop’s management has enriched shareholders at the expense of the firm. GameStop’s capital expenditure, the budget used to maintain its stores, peaked in 2011 at almost $200 million before getting cut in favor of larger dividends and share buybacks. Meanwhile, the company’s stores have continued to age, and layoffs have continued unabated. Yet, shareholders allowed then-CEO J. Paul Raines to maintain the course. Why? It made them money. Customers, employees and other stakeholders weren’t a priority. And after several failed acquisitions, including game developer Kongregate, GameStop’s management decided that milking the company for cash was a better bet. The firm’s blind commitment to mediocrity reached a peak at the April 2020 strategy meeting. There, GameStop management outlined a plan to “optimize the core” and “become the social / cultural hub for gaming” through building “experiential labs.” In other words, they wanted to drive more in-store traffic. During a pandemic year. (How on earth did management earn $35 million between them?)  Change Afoot? Redditors Think So.  All that began to change in August 2020, when Chewy founder Ryan Cohen bought 9 million shares of the retailer. He and two associates would later join the board in January 2021. “GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences — not remain a video game retailer that over-prioritizes its physical presence and stumbles on the online ecosystem,” said Mr. Cohen in a public letter to the board. Investors were delighted, sending shares on an initial run from $4 to $40. Mr. Cohen wasn’t just talking about improving e-commerce (a strategy that might have worked 15 years ago). Instead, he spoke of fundamental changes to GameStop’s business that could create a new, revitalized player in the $180 billion gaming industry. Change, however, won’t come readily. And that’s where Reddit investors come in. To date, Mr. Cohen only owns 13% of the company. That’s not enough to dislodge GameStop’s existing board; as late as last year, the board fought off another activist investor with grand plans for change. To be clear, there’s nothing particularly nefarious about current CEO George Sherman or his team. (Redditors, please don’t send pizzas to his house at 1 a.m.) Managing a declining business is already hard during good times and nearly impossible during crises. But to become an agent of change, Mr. Cohen needs more than his vote in the video game retailer. He needs other investor support.  Reddit Investors, Unite!  To date, Reddit investors have driven up GME stock using a financial quirk known as delta-gamma hedging. It happens when many investors buy deeply out-of-the-money calls — the lottery tickets favored by the r/WallStreetBets crowd. And in one of Wall Street’s least-understood processes, as prices rise, market makers will buy more GME stock to hedge their positions. That creates a feedback loop that pushes prices even higher. But for GameStop to reach a $500 price (and stay there), Redditors will need more than Wall Street’s quirks. To do more, they will need the four tools of activist investors: invest, strategize, agitate and vote.  Activist Investing 101  There’s the obvious first step with activist investing: Investors need to buy GameStop shares and hold on. Options can make you fabulously wealthy, but only common stockholders can vote in shareholder meetings. Next, investors need to strategize what’s best for GameStop. Sucking the lifeblood out of a dying company can make shareholders some money, but it won’t turn GME into a $35 billion firm. Neither will trying to beat established players like Twitch or Valve at their own game. Instead, winning strategies will involve identifying technologies a decade out and investing before others do. (A virtual reality universe, anyone?) Third, shareholders need to make their voices heard — something Redditors seem pretty good at doing already. With a single well-crafted public letter to the board (plus some backroom dealing), Mr. Cohen managed to gain three board seats. Smaller investors might not have the same platform, but they can undoubtedly start pressuring GME’s board to move faster. And finally, shareholders need to vote. Most investors typically outsource voting to their brokerages, making annual meetings a rubber-stamp ordeal. But unless shareholders come to Mr. Cohen’s aid, change won’t come fast enough.  Time Is Running Out for GME Stock  Reddit and Mr. Cohen will have to work fast. Thanks to their years of corporate debt binging, GameStop now sports a 3.5x debt-equity ratio. The retailer spends over $300 million in interest, upkeep and leasing costs, which will burn through its $446 million cash hoard faster than most people expect. Mr. Cohen has presumably seen the writing on the wall. Without drastic changes, GameStop’s chances will melt away faster than the ice cream cone that Mr. Cohen mysteriously posted on Twitter this week. That’s what makes CFO Jim Bell’s resignation on Wednesday so remarkable. Clearing the caretaker ranks is an essential first step to a turnaround, and Mr. Cohen seems to have pulled the board out of its slump. But more still has to happen. And Mr. Cohen needs your help, Reddit. For GameStop to reach $500, the firm would need a $35 billion market capitalization, or more than the value of Twitch and Steam combined. A secondary offering at $150 per share would be a start. A roughly 10% dilution would raise $1 billion, something AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) did during its January stock run-up. But money alone won’t solve GameStop’s decline. The firm desperately needs a new vision among its management ranks. Re-hiring a COO would be a good first step — the firm hasn’t bothered with one since 2019. Charting a long-term strategy (and finding the right person for the job) would be even better. In short, GameStop needs a strategy shift that should make even Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) co-founder Reed Hastings nod in approval. Mr. Cohen has worked his magic on Chewy.com before. And maybe he’s even the right person to take the top job at GameStop. But before he can start down that route, the 35-year-old founder will need all the help he can get. And with a Reddit-fueled megaphone, retail investors finally have the chance to make that happen. Good luck, Redditors. I’ll see you guys on the moon. On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. Tom Yeung, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing. That’s nothing.  Wait until you see what the CFO at GME is likely to walk away with at the end of March. Over $50M of stock at current value if he gets all shares AND a severance package that has been estimated to be worth over $3.5M per reports.   So potentially $53 million to walk away  Bullshit I say ! Don’t you feel crunchy now! Either the shorter get the money or the CFO you pick!!! Remember the GME CFO.  Sometimes the bad guys are C-level. Could be a play to demoralize reddit as well. You guys might not have the stomach for these sorts of things if news like this upsets you guys.  The fact is, this whole GME/AMC movement helped out a lot of people you'd find despicable.  For a few hedgefuds and CEOs and CFOs we fucked over, tons made bonuses and profit and still actually have the control over the ""to the moon movement"".   Not to mention a lot of little guys are going to get hurt to cover the mess for the big bosses.  Did y'all actually believe any of y'all were doing something noble? lol Fired all? You mean one CFO? Who else was fired aside from the CFO? I disagree. It touched 200 on Thursday. First time in almost a month. GME hasn’t unveiled their platform yet which is big. Still a new CFO to be named and Papa Cohen still has the ability to buy 6% more shares. Upping his stake by 50% to the tune of around 4M shares. I think that’s move the needle in our favor. BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon.  HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK. The past week has been fucking rough for us SPCE boys, but good things on the horizon. Bottom line the market doesn’t understand the space industry and how common multiple setbacks are. People not familiar with the space industry want things to happen and want them to happen now. I am very intimate with the space community and have many friends in the industry. The test flight delays overshadowed the strong points mentioned on the earnings call.  1. Comparison: In 2015, SpaceX’s valuation was 10.1B. Today they’re valued at 74B. Going off of market cap, which I know doesn’t represent the whole picture, Virgin is comparable at 9.9B. While SpaceX used government contracts to scale their business and Virgin is mostly focused on the commercial aspects, they are both ultimately trying to capture a similar market – pay for play astronauts. Let’s flash back to 2015, when SpaceX had a similar valuation to our dear $SPCE:  • June 28, 2015 – rocket vaporized  • September 1, 2016 – explosion on launch pad  Now imagine SpaceX being a public company at this point, it’s shares would have tanked. But smart investors (VC bubbas) didn’t panic. In November 2017 SpaceX raised a new round at a valuation of 21.3B – twice it’s valuation from 2 years before despite 2 very public failures with defense (their biggest customer!!) payloads on board. Virgin doesn’t have the comfort of having a few setbacks, because instead of 1B bloated defense satellites on board they have human lives. They have to do everything necessary to protect themselves from that – all while worrying about being a public company! No one remembers the multidude of Spacex failures from 2006-2015. They just see a stable service provider worth almost 75B and wish they could have invested in it. But if it was public, people would’ve been just as hesitant as they’re being with $SPCE today.  2) Leadership changes: Virgin has made it clear that their CFO was only staying on board to aid the transition from private to public. They had shit timing tbh by dropping the update on earning’s day, but this was expected. After the first full year as a traded company, the CFO parted ways to allow space for the fulltime executive. Additionally, they’ve added multiple former Disney executives to oversee their commercialization plan. This experience will have a huge positive impact when $SPCE delivers spaceflight to customers. Think of the combination of the Disney experience with your typical thrill-seeking events.  3) Spaceship 3: New space plane unveiled! I don’t know why everyone’s ignoring this. Virgin is expanding their fleet of servicing planes and improving their ability to provide a once in a lifetime experience to customers. This is coming on March 30 with testing this summer.  4) Financials: For those concerned with cash burn rate, chart mill fundamental analysis gives a current ratio of 6.81 and a quick ratio of 6.59 = no problem at all paying short term obligations. Altman Z score of 41.67 indicates no danger of bankruptcy. Yes they’re hurting, but we have nothing to compare it to. SpaceX was and is a private company who didn’t openly provide quarterly/annual financials. Think of this as creating an entire new industry, straight from Peter Thiel’s Zero to One. This is the stock that can make you a fortune. Just think of parallels you can draw. My mind goes to Tesla, who didn’t have a profitable year for their first 18 years as a company, yet still held a market cap of 100B in January 2020 based on excitement alone (2020 ended up being their first profitable year) – now has >6x’ed.  RECAP: I’m loading up on $SPCE. Come Monday I’m loading up on April calls (to take advantage of March SpaceShip 3 release) and June calls (for May test flight). Sure, come at me with the comparisons to SpaceX and Tesla, I DGAF. People cream at the idea of Elon leading a venture, well guess what Richard Branson was and has always been the epitome of a charismatic founder. All the Elon fanboys should be as hot and heavy about Branson as they are about Elon. Let him make you rich. Use your smooth silky brain to make a good choice and fucking buy $SPCE.  You do you, this isn’t financial advice I just love the stock."
ARD,11,15016," OPEN THE CASINO I NEED TO BE RETARDED W MY HARD EARNED MONEY I’m at a weird point in life looking FOWARD to Monday wtf lol A BASTARD FROM A BASKET!!! WOW. FUCKING EPIC STORY, HERE'S YOUR OSCAR AWARD 🍌 so what youre saying is, if I PULL HARD ENOUGH... AMEN BROTHER THAT WAS GOLD. ILL COME BACK WITH MY FREE AWARD LATER. So glad they took a $3,000 loan out in my name to give $1,600 to their corrupt friends and then give back $1,400 like they're some kind of hero's... But I'm sure they won't ever expect it back.. right? right??  Well, if it's my money anyway, let's make it count! ALL ABOARD GME!!! IS ANYONE WORRIED  THAT WHEN THE HEDGE FUNDS START SELLING THEIR OTHER ASSETS TO COVER THEIR LOSSES  IT COULD CREATE A DOWNWARD SPIRAL IN THE MARKET AND CRASH ALL ABOARD THE RKT SHIP. 1 WAY TICKET YOU DIRTY FUCKING APES Anyone still using Robinhood is an actual retard  We had a whole fucking month to get off there in between the first squeeze and now so the ‘well I don’t want my portfolio in limbo during the squeeze’ is no longer valid   Seriously, I repeat, if you’re still on Robinhood, you are a RETARD and I don’t mean that in any nice way Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"

Make 0 mistake, this is exactly how Tesla got into sp500--to give the system endless boomer retirement money to get out of their short trade. This is also how the Tesla split happened.   Imho, Musk knew there were counterfeit shares of Tesla out there being shorted to take retail money, and must have had proof, because otherwise, when he said he secured funding to go private (and lied), he would have went to jail. Whatever proof he had on the SEC (I suspect he rounded up enough stock holding whales to prove they owned all available stock), was enough for him to scare the bejesus out of those synthetic shorters when he said they secured private funding. If retail could somehow figure out a way to prove we own ALL gme shares (which I know without a doubt we do--this thing has worldwide attention with 50M float shares, really, u don't think 5M people hold on average 10 shares?!), we would win like tesla. MOD request: while we hodl and buy more shares, please help figure out a way to prove we own more than 70M shares, because I KNOW in my heart we do. The big companies say we’re out of our mind.

BUY THE FKN DIP BRO These mothafuckers shorted more shares than we bought???   YALL KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE TAX RETURNS ON MONDAY  Not my cat advise. I'm not a stock. I love the moon Fellow retards, I might be retarded but I'm just thinking about the future of GME. Ryan Cohen and team turned Chewy into a company worth 40 Billion. Currently trading at 103 a share. Chewy does not have a ton of assets its just an online e-commerce pet store. He beat Amazon out to become the primary pet supply online retailer.  GME actually has real assets, stores all across the country. Imagine what he could do with that. GME 3.8B market cap is absolutely undervalued.  Ryan Cohen saw an opportunity with gamestop, to take a dying company and turn it around doing what he ALREADY KNOWS HOW TO DO.  In short, I like the stock. If I can make some money on a squeeze I'm happy - if somehow things don't work out with a squeeze I'm happy to hold. I'm looking at bringing my average down soon and holding unless this thing pops off to the 1000s.  DFV is a very smart man.   Pos: 46 GME @ 133"
IG,11,371," AIG to the moon! I shared this on my IG story lol. YO, THIS IS NOT A BIG SECRET.  THE STOCK HAS A BETA OF -2.3.    replace all that text with this:  GME beta =     -2.3 Wait wait wait,  so this smooth brain mfr wrote a 3mil check to cover a loss on a loan,  BUT DUMB ASS COULDN'T DROP 3MIL INTO GME STOCK AND HELP IGNITE THE THRUSTERS ON THIS ROCKET??!!??  Tldr: you sir, are truly retarded A note on the possible ways shorts could worm their way out of this and one BIG problem we could face. To start off with, I have to say that this post is not intended to spread FUD or to discourage people. This is a post to help us “plan for the worst and hope for the best”. It is to open a discussion with people more knowledgeable than myself who can help clear up some of these issues.  &#x200B;  While commenting on another post I started to realise some of the ways the hedge funds could try and climb out of this hole they have dug, or at least screw us over in the process of a squeeze. I have not seen these points being discussed nor do I know of any solid reasons why they couldn’t happen.  There is evidence that the shorts have already used illegal actions to supress the price and delay a full squeeze on GameStop. I cannot comment on whether they DEFINITELY committed any crimes, but in the interest of risk management I think we all need to presume they have done, and will do again.  You see, when an organisation has as much money as some of these hedge funds, they have power as well. Real power. Most people would presume the age of the 1% getting away with everything has passed, but it has just become more subtle. As the world saw in 2008, these people can and do get away with their crimes, even if it destroys entire economies.  Anyway, to get to the point, I have been thinking about multiple ways the shorts can and possibly will try and save themselves, or at least stop us from seeing the full potential of the squeeze.  \[Note: Some of these points are aimed directly at brokerages, but with the possibility that hedge funds may have pulled strings to manipulate the brokers in mind. i.e., Actions of brokerages that directly benefit the short sellers.\]  \[Note 2: This whole post is to be taken as a question of sorts. I am not stating facts, merely presenting problems. If anyone actually knows the definitive answer or likelihood to any of these problems then please comment.\]  &#x200B;  * **Brokerages block the ‘sell’ option.**  Considering our problem last time was them blocking buys, this might not immediately seem like such a bad thing, because that would mean the price would only go up, right?  Stopping further short selling would benefit us as the price couldn’t be supressed as much, but stopping us from selling would just mean the price would go up, and we’d be left watching as we are unable to ever sell. As much as I am willing to hold forever if I have to, we are all hoping for it to reach such a price where we would sell eventually.  But wouldn’t this be illegal? Would it? I thought that blocking buys would be illegal but apparently not. If they can block the buys they can probably block the sells as well – they bury a lot of manipulative and controlling stuff in their terms and conditions. If anyone with a greater understanding of the law knows about the legality of restricting selling could let us know then that would be helpful.  &#x200B;  * **Brokerages allow people to sell at extreme profits, but refuse to pay the astronomical prices.**  This is one that definitely **should** be illegal, and something even the most untouchable couldn’t get away with. With that said, I don’t feel comfortable resting everything on a ‘should’. Whether you think it at all possible or not, imagine if the massive target of $30million per share actually happens. Can you really see all these brokerages just coughing up straight away without any fuss?  Or, is it at all possible that they could yet again hide behind legal loopholes and fine print to refrain from paying us those amounts? “There is a maximum amount you can have in your account at one time”, “This is over the maximum amount of money we can handle in a transaction”, “Due to the extreme volatility of this stock, sell order could not be processed, the number you are seeing on screen is incorrect and will be removed from your account. Do not try to withdraw any of this money.” The list goes on.  I especially want to make it clear here that I am asking if any of this is possible. I am a bit of an idiot but I think a discussion is worth having on these matters, because as far as I am concerned, everything is on the table and nothing is too farfetched.  &#x200B;  * **Brokerages artificially fake outages and failures, blocking people from using their services and pretending they were just overwhelmed with the extreme, sudden increase in volume of users again.**  How do we know they haven’t already done this? They can stop people from trading freely while blaming technology and even the large amount of people using their service.  &#x200B;  * **Hedge funds digitally attacking brokerages to cut off a large chunk of retail investors and lock them out of the squeeze.**  Is it possible the hedge funds could pay others to attack the brokerages digitally, whether through something like a DDoS attack or other methods? I imagine they would especially target the large no-commission brokers like Robinhood and T212.  It also seems to me like it would be a difficult crime to trace back to the hedge funds, and I actually see very little reason why hedge funds wouldn’t be able to do this. With the amount of money the hedgies are set to lose, they are going to be desperate and willing to resort to desperate measures. If this did happen and we were unable to sell then would we be entitled to compensation?  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  # THE BIG ONE.  **\[Update:** I have had numerous people commenting with good explanations of the following point. I am now considering 'THE BIG ONE' not so big anymore, and thank you all for your input.\]  If the main shorts responsible for all of this go bankrupt before they are able to buy back every single share they’d have to, what would happen then?  If the numbers people are estimating are even close to the true possible number then I would say it’s very likely they’d go bankrupt very quickly. It is my understanding that most debts of sorts are written off when a company or organisation files for bankruptcy, which is the main reason some people force their own companies into bankruptcy only the re-launch with a different name and no debt.  If we really do destroy the hedge funds that are behind the majority of the short positions, then do we destroy ourselves in the process? I can’t see them being forces to pay up billions upon billions in debt if they are bankrupt, because they would never reasonably obtain that money. In that case, who is going to pay?  My best guess is that in one the worst case scenarios the price skyrockets as they cover as much as they can and then it just stops when they run out of money. No one else is going to voluntarily buy those shares at those prices so wouldn’t we end up with GME stalling at an insane price but with no one able to sell and no one able to buy, meaning the share price would just… stop?  If that did happen then I can’t see the SEC or the US Government (simply because it’s a US stock) doing nothing as for the first time a stock get’s infinitely stuck. Therefore, would they then artificially lower the price to get people buying again? This would mean none of us could actually sell at the price it reaches.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  If you even made it this far you are all probably pissed off at me for saying it over and over, but I am NOT claiming any of this will happen. The last thing I want to do is unintentionally spread FUD. I’m presuming some will call me a shill anyway for even bringing these points up but I need to clarify that I am invested in GME and I am confident that it will squeeze at some point. I am 100% in this cause, and I don’t believe this is any reason for people to worry or be demotivated.  With that said, I am not so naïve as to presume this will all go perfectly for us with no obstacles – just look at last time when they stopped us from buying and killed the upwards momentum. We need to be as best prepared as we can, and ideally we need a legal ‘mutually assured destruction’ to dissuade anything I have mentioned here.  What I am asking for is for people to PLEASE prove me wrong. If any of you have a greater knowledge of the law or the inner workings of things then please comment and let us all know.  &#x200B;  Thank you to anyone who may be able to help. I ape, but listen....listen.....  AMC small boom———>GME BIG BOOM.  GME ENDGAME.  Not investor, I APE.  (Ape’s laugh and screech) No, I don't do pot stocks like that.  I have been swinging IGC steadily.  It's an easy predictable play. Wow....Love it...BIG Smile on me right now...  Waiting on next part  #Terms of the bet:  * If GME hits $500 by the end of February, I will drink my own piss  * If GME doesn’t hit $500 by then, GME Apes who accept the bet must read a book on investing, personal finance, or philanthropy.

Exactly 4 out of the 160 comments agreed with me.    I still think GME is a terrible investment. Ryan Cohen’s last company CHWY [has yet to turn a profit.](https: www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/chwy/earnings). Maybe you apes are right and he’s a Business Jesus, but I invest based on numbers not on personality cults, and I haven’t seen any impressive numbers yet that would convince me to buy and hold GME. I do see numbers now and then (like IV%) that convince me to trade short-term--so I still hope it hits $500, I just don’t think it will. My long-term price target is between $2 and $36. I’ll adjust that at the next earnings report (and you should adjust your targets then too).   #Results   Calling all apes who made the bet! There aren’t any trading days left in February.

TW,10,91," I mean... you lost. You had a chance to win. You didn't take it. You got your rocket, then you ignored it. It's like the God's Helicopter joke. No one in the history of equities gets TWO chances to get out. And still you ""hlod"". Wtf? GME TO THE MOON!!! ROUND TWO LETS GO 🚀🌕 What a masterpiece of a movie and meme. Been waiting for someone to use TWBB. 🙏  The fucking mods, too good Shit you want me to cry? BTW VR is awesome. Also WHY LET TWO COMPANIES YOU GREW UP ON DIE CAUSE OF SOME FUXBOIS? Dude. ONE or TWO garbage brokers limited buys. Anyone who had a brain and money could buy. Round one failed exactly because peopel were jumping in for quick bux instead of long game. This is a bad strategy. You people shouldn't have FOMO'd to begin with...but since you are short bus apes and did, there isn't much to be done about that.  Take your loss and put it into a stock that can actually rocket...   You really want to miss out on a year or two of possible gains because you think BB might eventually recover?  EDIT: fuck it, stay broke. Your loss porn is fun to laugh at.   You guys must be salty that you missed out on GME, TWICE  It is so fun arguing with all these BRAND NEW ACCOUNTS, or accounts that have been dormant for years. What a bunch of shills. Be careful people...some true pumpers out here I have no fucking idea what this post means. But it feels important. I use Robinhood. I tried fidelity and other brokerages but didn't like it. Robinhood  has the  best UI.  I went back to scummy robinhood. And If someone could explain what OP means that would be cool.  BTW I'm not borrowing money from robinhood to buy more GME. Am I safe as long as I don't borrow money?  Edit 2. I sold all my GME to buy more AMC then I tried to sell AMC at a profit to buy more GME. But fucking day trading protection stopped me and now I have 0.7 shares of GME in total. Fucking hate my life [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates Yeah I had a nice little working theory but then I saw that TWTR had that great ER performance.   I’m looking into the dates they’re scheduled for my First hints and working outward"
FB,10,124,"  It  will be all over for game stop holders, again, very soon. **It's a matter of when, not if, the price will plummet again**. And yes I know I'm just  stating the obvious:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2021/02/27/gamestop-stock-gme-price-rise-is-enticing-but-misleading--dont-get-trapped/?sh=6c0aee3c6337](https: www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2021/02/27/gamestop-stock-gme-price-rise-is-enticing-but-misleading--dont-get-trapped/?sh=6c0aee3c6337)  Like we didn't know already, but a lot of you seem to be in denial, the average target price based on 8 analysts is around 13$.

This time will be even quicker most likely as the pump was not as sustained and it has been dropping on intraday charts since a high of 180ish on Thursday.  And finally, in case you missed it or were just incredibly naive, seems like I'm not the only shill on reddit. **At least I'm human, and the ratio of bots pumping gamestop for every rational  bear is probably 20:1.** There are thousands of bots pumping GME on twitter, reddit, FB and probably elsewhere:  [https: finance.yahoo.com/news/thousands-bots-may-played-role-200934785.html](https: finance.yahoo.com/news/thousands-bots-may-played-role-200934785.html)  Don't worry about the usual insults, never cared anyway and I'll just assume your a bot anyway. Good luck to all fellow retards, put and call holders alike.  Your Resident (Human) Shill. I worked on the phones at fidelity when the FB ipo broke the system and couldn't keep up.  Anyone who placed multiple market orders thinking they weren't getting filled screwed themselves.  We were instructed to only enter cancel and replace orders.

FBI can suck my dick, same goes for anyone who thinks that there are any more options left. The curtain is being pulled back and how things really operate are there for you to see. I swear, every movie I’ve seen, story told about ANYTHING doing with gambling always has that one person who tries to get out of a bet. What do they do to those people every time they don’t pay?  I am a humble retard 💎🤲🚀🌙 No offense, but I think you're not quite right here. If it hit 10,500, given the negative correlation with the market as GME rises, FB's market cap would be lower than it currently is. So, GME might not even have to hit 5 figures to surpass FB's market cap. First, FHA loans are the worst of all agency loans. Lower FICOs, lower down payments, etc. In addition, Freddie, Fannie and Ginnie are working to help borrowers refinance if needed. I believe you only need 3 months of payments now to qualify for a refinance.   Second, subscribe to MBA. They send out daily emails and update deliquencies on a weekly basis. I work in the mortgage industry, FBs are headed down to manageable levels. I don't believe anyone is preparing or hedging for a crash.   Another free daily blog is put out by Rob Chrisman and almost everyone I know in the mortgage industry reads it. RH needs a time out, CEO needs jail time or this will happen again.  They need to finenthem 100X + 5 years Jail time for second offense and shut down RH. No third strike.   SEC is a joke, hello FBI Hello Apes,   This is one of my first posts and am going to try to make this a weekly thing to help you apes and autists out.   Hedgefunds and asset management firms have these analysts preparing all these market forecasts all the time. I feel like us apes could come together to defeat the hedgies by putting all our thoughts together and getting a sense of how the market might look like in the near future. So we can get tendies! Who wants tendies? I want tendies!  Please note this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I am just an ape. This is purely for education purpose. Please consult a financial advisor not me.  You all must be wondering, what the hell is going on in the market lately? Why are stonks down? Where are my tendies?  Well Apes, apparently there are these things called bonds. JPOW sells these things at auctions and people buy them! Can you believe it? People actually buy things other than stonks.  Lately these bond traders have been very worried that things are getting back to normal! There's $1.9 trillion on its way and that means tendies! Tendies for everyone! And that means prices of things might go up. And if that happens then Fed might have to raise interest rates to keep the prices from getting out of control!  These genuis bond traders have ultra paper hands and they were expecting rates to rise in 2023. But they are afriad they might go up in 2022! Oh lawd! Have mercy.  If interest rates go up. It means stonks go down! Witchcraft! These bond traders are scared and pooping their pants. No one is buying, which is driving the prices of some of these bonds down. means yields are rising! Rising yields oh no!  Everyone is panicking and cashing out.  So bond traders are all looking at JPOW like what you gonna do. You gonna keep running that printer or stop? JPOW is like. Whatever YOLO. But bond traders are not convinced. They feel like JPOW like a cheating boyfriend is lying and will probably backstab them and raise rates.  So bond traders don't wknow what to do. They are panicking. Scared and running around like chickens without heads. All this fear is spreading into the stock market and people are selling their stocks.  Stocks are down! Stocks are down! Stocks are down!  So what's ahead? Well Feb's job report is out on FRIDAY. If the numbers look good Thats Bad! Good means bad because it means things are getting back to normal. No! Bond traders don't want things to get back to normal. If numbers are bad Thats good! Because that means less risk of higher rates.  Good is bad and bad is Good!  What in the world is going on?!?  Well - All you need to know is JPOW is speaking on Thursday. Everyone will be watching. If he says something stupid... Stonks will go down. So lets hope he doesn't say anything stupid. Job reports out on Friday. If report is good then more red!   Also - Expect some more red if bond traders panic a bit more and drag the stocks down. If there is fear in the market then fewer insitutions will buy stuff. Apes are still buying. So keep buying and keep holding those diamond hands. Don't paper hand! Hold Strong! Let the insitution paper hand. If we keep holding. The market will stabilize in the next week or so. If we buy that means more tendies.  All the best Apes. Just remember, expect turbulence ahead. But it will pass in a week or so. As soon as those stimulus cheques hit the streets, there will be tendies! Glorious tendies.  Apes:   What is Queen Cathie doing:    Investors took out $1 billion out of her funds last week. People are pancking. Queen Cathie is staying calm and Diamond Handing (Bought): Palantir, Twitter, Square, Paypal, Signify Health, Baidu, JD, Tesla, Spotify.   She is Paper-Handing (Sold): Apple, FB, Snap, Alibaba, Salesforce, Amazon, Alphabet, Roku  vs.  Hedgies:    Paul Singer: ""Crash is coming! Can't wait to say I told you so!""     Let's see who wins in the next couple of weeks. If you thougth last week was volatile. Just wait till you see whats in store for the next couple of weeks!  Apes Strong -  If you disagree or have any questions, feel free to msg me or leave a comment. Thanks!"

Well....IF YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE FOLKS FUCK YOU BECAUSE $GME & $AMC HODLERS ARE ON A ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON AND YOU'RE NOT INVITED SO GO SHILL SOMEWHERE ELSE. Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS.

You know i really enjoy jerking off, and before i wasn't interested in GME stonks (/s) but now you say there is DOUBLE the potential for jerking off? You son of a bitch, Im in. Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
NLY,9,1792," NO SELL  ONLY BUY OR HOLD The conditions have changed.     Originally the short positions were ALL under water. As the stock rose, say from $4 - $40, 140% of the float was short. If you were, for instance, 1,000,000 shares short at $4... You now were $40,000,000 upside down.      The HEAVY options activity back in January meant that call writers needed to hedge their risk as the price rose. There was one day it went from $20-$30 (50%) and then $30-$40. As that happened the likihood of those options expiring in the money became more realistic and the call writers needed to go get the shares in the case they had to deliver them to option owners. It literally was a BOMB waiting to explode.      Add in the WSB retail interest, the low float, and you had a catalyst for the stock to ONLY GO UP. Literally. An amazing historical moment in the history of finance.      After the wednesday when the price spiked from $60-$120 we saw a lot of profit taking and a lot of shorting at $120. This crashed the price to $60. This is the first moment that some new shorts entered at $120. Those positions were now healthy at $60.     Despite this, most shorts and most of the shorted float was still REALLY underwater big time. The big shorters were being margin called. As they were margin called they began selling blue-chips and their main holdings to get liquidity, this is why the market dipped big, and some shorters were margin called and liquidated- forced to close their positions.      So then the price went north of $120, now ALL shorters are under water again, and likely some started buying call options to hedge if this thing went up more. This actually exasperated the problem and made it more likely to go up due to call writers hedging.      So add in: 140% short float, margin calls, volatile stock, a lot of call options ITM, retail interest and WSB hype, PLUS big hedge funds were now entering the fun to make money on the squeeze.      POP... Price goes parabolic. Thursday night many shorts were looking at multi-billion dollar losses that they could not pay. The brokers would have had to pay those. So the brokers all decide to stop letting GME be bought. The shorters go to work Friday and sell, sell, sell... They drive the price down to $200 while opening new shorts at $450. Now a lot of shorts are in the green, but they haven't necessarily closed.   &#x200B;  Over the course of the next week people become despondent, fearful, and many sell. This gives shorts that opened at $450 downwards lots of liquidity to close shorts if they want, banking a killing. Those original shorts under $40 MAY have been closed as they were to average out with their other plays that worked. All in all most shorts are now hedged with long and short plays so nothing in particular can kill them. They are no longer cornered.      Since then the price has went UP and DOWN a lot. Every time it goes up it's a new opportunity for new short positions and new long positions. Every time it goes down it's an opportunity for shorts to close and bank profit and new longs to go in. The positions of every player now mean no one is overly compromised or stuck, there are just a lot of players involved with different profit targets. This means we shouldn't see any big margin calls or any forced covering of shares. These guys can wait it out, or they are hedging with their long calls if the price goes crazy stupid up. They are not idiots despite getting in this situation.      So while the GME price might be volatile and it might even get back to $500 the underlying infinite squeeze is no longer possible.      The only real way that the average retail guy can make money now is by being smart with your price entry and your price exit. Have a price target. Do you want to make 10%, 20%, 50%? Have that in mind and start taking profits once you are ahead. All that capital you will make you can use on your next trade.      Good luck to everyone, but do not buy into this situation as the conditions being the same as before- they are SO different... I ONLY WIPE WITH DIAMOND HANDS Togheter we will do this ONLY togheter!! HOLD! Problem with day traders is that they buy and sell each day, which is effectively counterproductive for the squeeze. This is the HF’s latest trick, dont fall for it. The ONLY play is to buy and HOLD! 💎🙌🏼 Hey folks! I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.  Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:  So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101). I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:     TL;DR: You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.    Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic. Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:  you start with ~0~ shares you borrow one from a broker you now have ~1~ shares you sell that share, completing your short you now have ~0~ shares  Now imagine the short squeeze happens. And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc. The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).  Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high: Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital.  You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.  you start with ~0~ shares you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker! you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!  Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with!  Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value:   THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?  Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy. Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.   If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations. Now think about that again.   Effective TL;DR 2.0:  People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule? Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.  But here’s MY question: What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it?  VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.   Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not. Joy to all, ~Unimportant   (this is not financial advise, and I am not a financial advisor) 100k per share defs sounding more and more feasible with each DD I read but ONLY if the majority of apes on here agree in unison. \*This is not financial advice and I’m not a licensed or registered securities analyst/provider. Basically, I know nothing so do listen to me. Just some context to what is happing and a guess on what the Pro's will do as they continue to manipulate GME.  Difference between Options and betting on a football game. Betting on a football game doesn’t affect the outcome. If enough people buy call options it can affect the outcome.  **Conclusion: Pro’s will BANG THE CLOSE on Thursday March 18th for April 1 Call options**  Apparently, the Pro’s are buying call option positions at the close somewhat near where the stock is trading (at the money) causing the market makers to delta hedge (estimated .66) and buy shares in the open market. For every contract (100 shares) the market makers sell at the money (near current price), they will need to hedge by buying about .66 (delta) shares on the open market. Buying pressure can increase the price sparking more interest (feedback loop).This is how the bet influences the outcome. This is the way.  The last two months they did it in the last trading week of the month. I’m thinking they could disguise their intent by executing their strategy the week before GME reports Q4 earnings. They haven’t been waiting til Friday so my guess is it would take place earlier maybe on Wednesday or Thursday. Friday the 19th is Quadruple Witching day so volatility in the overall market will be higher.  BANG THE FORUM would also fuel the rocketship. Hedge Funds are spying on the reddit forum (Point 2). They have programs to scrape every letter on this forum and calculate sentiment.  I could see them buying contracts and faking an increase in sentiment by posting the letters GME in a lot of replies so it looks like [r/wallstreetbets](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) are about to go gang busters on GME. If the letters GME show up in many post replies then everyone will be thinking that redditors are about to buy a lot of GME. The idiot hedge funds will go out and buy stock/options to front run the retail investor. If the [r/wallstreetbets](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) crowd also included “GME” in replies it could further fuel it as the Pro’s manipulate the market. This is the way.  [**Point 0: Movement in GME is repeatable (feedback loop)**](https: www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/25/nothing-specific-caused-gamestop-rally-says-strategist.html?&qsearchterm=Nothing%20specific%20caused%20GameStop%20rally)  (click up here \^\^\^ for CNBC video \^\^\^)  Catalyst relatively simple (feedback loop)….we started to tick up on Thursday and got above $50. THEN major option trades went off fueling the rocketship to the moon! Parabolic!!  2:58pm stock at $53, 750 contracts at $50 strike expire tomorrow (1 day) paid $6.85 (about $500k). Within 10 mins stock at $68 or so and not long later dropped to $60  3:27pm stock at $60.80, 400 contracts at $60 strike $7.75 (about $300k)  (Feedback loop) People on the other side of the trade (sellers of contracts) have to hedge and buy shares. Craziness will happen with only 20 minutes left to the close. All this from ONLY $800k in call option activity!! That’s nothing….a little skeptical.  [**Point 1: SEC former regulator foreshadows next squeeze (End of March)**](https: www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/26/there-are-institutional-traders-behind-gamestop-frenzy-former-sec-regulator.html)  (click up here \^\^\^ for CNBC video \^\^\^)  First Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the January  Second Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the February (not as many short sellers)  Projected Third Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the March (huge month for trade, month and quarter end)  **Point 2: Hedge Funds spying on** [r/wallstreetbets](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)\*\*, use it against them\*\*  Investors (HF’s, Institutions, etc.) are paying service providers to spy on the forum and count everytime someone mentions Gamestop or the ticker. They are tracking the sentiment of the forum to front run the action. If you talk about Gamestop a lot and type in the ticker then each mention gets counted and if there is a significant increase then the HF’s may consider buying the stock and/or options to participate in any increase before it goes parabolic.  **Point 3: Q4 2020 earnings expected to be out in “late March”**  I expect the earnings date will be announced two weeks prior, so that puts you around March 8th Monday to March 11th Thursday. Earnings date probably between 23rd to the 25th, two weeks after the announcement of the date.  11/24/2020 (Tuesday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/08/2020 (Tuesday)  08/26/2020 (Wednesday) GME announces Q2 earnings release on 09/09/2020 (Wednesday)  05/28/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q1 earnings release on 06/09/2020 (Tuesday)  03/12/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q4 earnings release on 03/26/2019 (Thursday)  11/25/2019 (Monday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/10/2019 (Tuesday)  **Point 4: Options Cubed - GME is spring loaded for volatility**  The somewhat binary outcome of survive or die combined with a very credible activist investor (Ryan C.) is accelerated with material changes and establishing a better alignment with the secular tailwinds of gaming.  Buying call options is like an option on an option on an option, Options Cubed. For that reason, you would expect them to be priced accordingly. However, even after the first squeeze massively help by the short sellers, we sat in the $40-$60 range with out of the money call options price extremely cheap. As if they were normal options. Let’s see how cheaply someone is willing to sell a $70 call option if this stock tanks to the $50s next week.  **Point 5: Probability says buy April 1 Call options**  You don’t know when the parabolic moves will happen but the media clips above in point 2 suggest it will happen in the last week of the month. Since you don’t know when, the task is the following:  Detail Outcomes --> Assign Probabilities (subjective) --> Calculate Expected Value  Lets say next week GME drops to the $50-$60 range and out of the money call options are cheap like the aftermath of the first squeeze.  15x return --> 10% chance of another move just simply to $100 (a $60 Strike call option would be worth about $45 to $60 with a stock price move to $100 again)  0x return --> 90% chance we never get above $50 again  Expected Value = (15x \* .1) + (0x \* .9) = 1.5x return  On average a 50% return is expected. So if you think there is a greater than 10% chance of another move to $100 once it falls to the $50-$60 range then the expected return only goes up assuming you can get at least a 15x return on your contract. How do I transfer ONLY my GME shares to TD? Since they will reimburse ACAT transfers apparently? I want to keep RH for free option trading. For some reason I have been getting better pricing on options with RH vs Thinkorswim."
RAD,9,90," Right Time for Rite Aid ( RAD ) ? This analysis looks at one possible break-up scenario of the Rite Aid corporation that projects a return of more than 2.5X the closing share price of $19.58 on Friday, February 26, 2021.  Rite Aid (RAD) consists of two (2) parts:  1. The Retail Pharmacy business currently generating approximately $16 billion in annual revenues. 2. The Prescription Benefits Management (PBM) services business known as ELIXIR, currently generating approximately $8 billion in annual revenues.  One possible scenario for unlocking the value of RAD involves the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business and Rite Aid brand.  What is left is the ELIXIR PBM organization.  Here is an estimation of how such an approach might play out:  * In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash.  That represents an average price of $2.275 million per store. * Should RAD seek a buyer for its Retail Pharmacy business, it could sell its 2,450 remaining stores as well as the Rite Aid brand.  Despite the fact that many of these stores are located in highly attractive locations (CA, OH, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, VA, etc), let's discount the average value of each store by 20% (compared to the average price-per-store paid by Walgreens), and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $1.8 million per store. * At a average price of $1.8 million per store, RAD could reasonably generate proceeds of $4.4 billion with the sale of the entire Retail Pharmacy business, including the 2,450 locations and the Rite Aid brand name (assigning no good will value to the brand). * The remaining RAD organization essentially consists of a PBM branded as ELIXIR and a net amount of cash on hand of +$1.2 billion, assuming that $3.2 billion of the Retail Pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing long-term debt on the company's books. * ELIXIR's projected sales for RAD's fiscal year 2021 (ending February 2021) are approximately $8 billion.  During each of the past four (4) quarters, RAD has reported ELIXIR's year-over-year growth rate to be in the range of  23 - 29%. * ELIXIR's projected EBITDA for fiscal 2022 (begining March of 2021) will likely be approximately $200 million.  Once again, I am taking a conservative estimate, and basically considering that a business that has grown 23 - 29% each quarter for the past year, will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year. * With only 55,000,000 shares outstanding today, the $200 million EBITDA generated by ELIXIR translates to roughly $3.60 per share in earnings.  Using a highly conservative PE multiple of 8, a stock price of $28.80 results.   However, the cash-on-hand of $1.2 billion (from the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business after long-term debt payoff) produces additional value of $22.00 per share, resulted in a stock price value of more than $50 per share (which is more than 2.5X the closing price of $19.58 on Friday, February 26, 2021). * The newly created company, ELIXIR, would be well-positioned for growth in the small-to-mid-size opportunity segment of the $400 billion per year PBM industry.  With a net $1.2 billion in cash, that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition.  In conclusion, this analysis indicates that the conservative value of RAD today is $50 per share, well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market, which is just under $20.  The purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the Rite Aid corporation is the best strategic path forward.  (I personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $100 in the next 12 - 24 months if it keeps the entire organization fully in tact.)  Rather, the purpose of the post was to reveal the hidden value locked within RAD that is clearly being overlooked by the investment community, by analyzing one possible break-up scenario. Earnings date is estimated as April 15th.  I think the covid testing and vaccines will help RAD to come in higher than any estimates or whisper number.![img](emote|wsb_emojis|bull) As an insider tip, I know that certain local and state governments require employees to use Rite Aid in order to exercise their insurance Rx benefit program.  Which is neither here nor there, but with a CVS on every corner and a Walgreens in between, it does keep people coming in the doors.  Of course Rite Aids are notorious for their placement in low income or struggling areas.  Idk.  I am long on RAD and have been for years while it essentially does nothing. This sounds RAD ickle. I will look into this. Appreciate the post. I'll buy a shit ton of RAD if you guys let me hitch a ride on the GME 🚀 and get my portfolio out of red baboon butthole territory. Good observation, this is what the shorts do to RAD, and have for years. The thing I like about wsb, we are the short busters. I pray for the day wsb notices the RAD shorts. RAD mutual fund ownership is at 2115%.  Someone wants a short. Probably what they did back then.  Death eaters, all of them. I have purchased RAD shares, 2022 and 2023 LEAPs.  I have also purchased April 2021 calls anticipating that Q4 earnings will exceed expectations and guidance for the new fiscal year will top analyst projections."

FFS NO ONE CARES ABOUT UR TERRIBLE GME AND AMC PLAYS BRUH YOU FUCKING CLOWNS ARE RUINING WSB yOu sOuNd lyKe BITCH STFU IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT YOU THINK 😘 This is literally a Wendy's. I know it's been said a thousand times but GO TO R/INVESTING FOR SMARTER PLAYS [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates Wow, I had AMC 1DTE too which expired worthless yesterday, but I only put in $700. Are you seriously telling me you put 100k into GME options AFTER the pop w 1400% IV?   Wow... **First, I am not a financial analyst or am I here to advise on what to do, here to just share my personal insights for discussion/entertainment purposes only. I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

EXACT SAME HERE.  Except I have a wife and a dog, no job, living off unemployment, day old Reddit account, and a new love for wsb and everything you guys are doing.  Pooling all my money, gonna try and pick up my first 8 or 9 shares Monday morning.   I WANT TENDIES TOO!  But I want these fucks to bleed even more. I will be hodling with you apes!  TO THE MOON! 8.01  GAME OVER 💎🤲 Hey folks! I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.  Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:  So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101). I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:     TL;DR: You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.    Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic. Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:  you start with ~0~ shares you borrow one from a broker you now have ~1~ shares you sell that share, completing your short you now have ~0~ shares  Now imagine the short squeeze happens. And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc. The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).  Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high: Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital.  You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.  you start with ~0~ shares you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker! you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!  Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with!  Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value:   THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?  Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy. Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.   If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations. Now think about that again.   Effective TL;DR 2.0:  People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule? Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.  But here’s MY question: What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it?  VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.   Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not.

Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
HIG,9,28840," First off, welcome to Wendys! Where our advice isn’t financial, and our burgers are stuffed with crayons!  I’ve been watching people recently scream *100K IS NOT A MEME* into the void over and over again, so I decided to break out of my lurker shell for those of us wondering if 100k is actually a meme, aren’t sure where to set the sell limit, and are afraid they are going to miss the train to tendie town. If you’ve been wrinkling your forehead thinking about this hoping a wrinkle will transfer to your brain, this is the post for you.  I’ve pulled some numbers from the Volkswagen squeeze to hopefully give some comfort to those apes who (like me) wandered around completely lost about where to set their sell *(gasp)* limits. I know GME isn’t Volkswagen, but if somebody can find me a closer comparison, that would be great!

Go take a look. *EVERYBODY!*  I’ve pulled numbers from the chart, I know they don’t line up with the values from 2008 (stock split maybe?) but they are accurate when used relative to one another.  Here we go.  October 2nd: $263  October 3rd: $277  October 6th: $292  October 7th: $287  October 8th: $294  October 9th: $296  October 10th: $342  October 13th: $353  October 14th: $352  October 15th: $390  October 16th: $398 (High $428, Low $382) --> **NOT THE SQUEEZE**  October 17th: $358  October 20th: $277  October 21st: $242  October 22nd: $243  October 23rd: $229  October 24th: $210  October 27th: $520 (High $635, Low $324) --> **SQUEEZE**  October 28th: $500 (High $500, Low $471) --> **SQUEEZE**  October 29th: $517 (High $607, Low $491) --> **SQUEEZE**  October 30th: $500 (High $590, Low $485) --> **SQUEEZE**  October 31st: $499 (High $548, Low $472) --> **SQUEEZE**  The stock then trades around $400 for almost another 2 weeks before starting to make its way back down towards pre-squeeze levels.  *BEFORE THE SQUEEZE*, the price ramps up to a peak on October 16th of $428, before crashing down over the next 6 days back to a low of $210.85 on October 24th, at which point the squeeze squozes. Once squozen, it squozes for **5 DAYS**. If the price rises and crashes fast, it *wasn’t* the squeeze.  *Please!* Put away your fears that you are going to miss the squeeze. If we get to the true squeeze, you’ll have time to take a nap and still not miss it. Even if you went on vacation for a week perfectly around the Volkswagen squeeze, you’d still have almost 2 weeks to sell at ~80% of the squeeze average.  Is 100k a meme? I have no idea - but it *doesn’t matter*. The BEST way for us to get the HIGHEST price is to completely delete your sell limits, and wait for the squeeze to squoze. That way we all get the best price, and we don’t risk scrubbing the launch before take off. In addition, the HFs can see your sell limits, and will use whatever information they can against us. Just delete them.  Absolute worst case scenario is that you’re in a coma for the squeeze, and Papa Cohen drives you all the way to tendie town.  Now, (looks around) where is that lurker shell I crawled out of.  **TLDR**: The train to tendie town doesn’t just fly by and force you to jump off a moving train. The train **STOPS** at tendie town for a vacation. The best way to get the highest price is to delete your sell limits and wait for the squeeze to squoze.  *Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do whatever you want.*  <Insert rocket ship emoji>  Position: >0, <69.75M @ >$0, < $483 THIS IS GOOD. THEY GAVE BONUSES SO HIGH LEVEL EMPLOYEE DOESNT SELL THEIR SHARES. IT PRESERVES STOCK VALUE!!!! DUH!!! BUY HIGH!!!🚀🚀🚀 Shorts have been suppressing the price for months, genius move on the part of RKT management to smash them with the $1.10 divi.   New money will come in leading up to March 9th, finally breaking us out of this resistance at $24.  Shorts will also have to pay divi out of pocket (fuck em) AND a squeeze should be triggered as they scramble to cover. HOW HIGH WILL IT GO!? WAIT IF YOU'RE GONNA ACTUALLY LOOK INTO IT I WAS HIGH LAST NIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY #11 lol the scene is so perfect **First, I am not a financial analyst or am I here to advise on what to do, here to just share my personal insights for discussion/entertainment purposes only. I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS.

The last 4 days we have seen Short volume as a percent of total volume between 58-62%. During the last jump in price, we saw between 32-54%, so as a percent of daily volume, the shorts are even HIGHER than last time!  EDIT: Thank you u/RicFlairsCape \- correct about the volume being total volume, not total shorts. i have updated the formula, looking at total short volume executed. Agree we don't know if it is all new positions or not, but the volume increase of acted shorts is in line with what we saw last time.  My fellow apes!  boilerplate: i know nothing, i can't do math good. don't listen to me  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see a increase in short volume over the last 2 days!

PEO,9,15435," This is obviously staged and here is why.  &#x200B;  First of all, buy is written in all caps while sell is written grammatically correct. Second reason, the cat is closer to buy, of course he will hit it, why would a cat walk over to hit sell when buy is right there. Third reason, the cat isn't even real, no question regarding this reason please. Reason number four, there is ice cream truck music playing in the back, and I can say with confidence that it is impossible to fit an ice cream truck into somebody's house.  WAKE. UP. PEOPLE. It’s a great stock with great potential, it’s vastly undervalued. It’s the PEOPLES stock now.   I’m not a financial advisor and as such here is some free financial advice from Europe. Investing in GME instead of meth cocaine and other drugs with your stimulus checks will extend your life expectancy.    I like the stock, Crayolas and money.

I believe it will be worth 5x in 2 years time, If a short squeeze happens then thats just a bonus for us all!!!  I say buy and hold both if you can... THE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE BOGGED AGAIN DO YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE MEME  MEMEING THE STOCKS OF ANGRY MEN  IT IS THE MEMEING OF A PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT BE FUCKED AGAIN  WHEN THE BEATING OF YOUR HEARTS ECHOES THE BEATING OF HEDGE FUNDS  THERE IS A LIFE ABOUT TO START WHEN THE TENDIES COME DO NOT BE UPSET! THIS IS ACTUAL FUCKING PROOF YOU ALL DID THAT KEEP GOING AND REMEMBER WE CAN BOYCOTT WE ARE THE PEOPLE   HERE'S THE IDEA, WHEN THEY SUSPEND $GME, WAIT'EM OUT AND THEN KEEP BUYING IT.  WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO SUSPEND IT, HALT IT AND RESTRICT IT FOREVER??    FREE THE MARKET!! FREE THE PEOPLE!!! POWER TO THE PLAYERS!! Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.

NIO,9,58," I miss the time when we were talking about BABA NIO and AAPL on this sub 😭 Let's go NIO BABY NIO earnings anyone? Or anyone playing the build up to ER on Monday? How is RETO?? Do you think of another NIO?? Damn GL bro. I know I'm buying GME on Monday. Can't risk it now that this guy is YOLOing. Though I would have bought some NIO calls then parlayed that into GME/AMC. I visited the HQ of NIO last year during a business trip. Their expansion is quite remarkable! Food was good.  5/5 would visit again.   Sponsored by trivago Yea earnings will be fun. But your long calls should print. I’m confident NIO is 100+ EOY I also like NIO. Nice moves. Ignore the interns who have 30 day old accounts and bash. GO NIO!!! Been in since 10/1/19 @$1.32 and keep buying ever since! Never sell, always buy! Let’s GOOOOO!!!!"

I LIKE THE STONK! Theyre acting intentionally malicious in abid to get us to sell so the hedge funds dont get screwed again. Theyre trying to play both sides of the short by giving themselves bonuses to make out while it goes up but using the negative pr if everyone decides to sell so they can short it again. But thats just a theory, a STONK THEORY. This isnt financial advice AMC/GME STONKS: YOU MUST HAVE A CASH ACCOUNT!! GME: WORLD OF STONKS"
HY,9,17718," Squeeze or gamma squeeze? This stock has squeezed so many times this month already. It’s a cow that produces infinite milk. Look at last week. Look at the chart.  WHY is it still being squeezed is the question you should ask yourself. My question to you is: are you profiting off the squeeze like I am or speculating about to jump in still?   I’m not telling you to buy the stock. I’m just explaining very loosely how I profited and will continue to do so without selling shares :) Can someone explain to me WHY the squeeze will last days/weeks? This was a good explanation for how it works under the “WHY THE GAMESTOP (GME) SHORT SQUEEZE WAS SO MASSIVE,” subhead:   https: millennialmoney.com/gamestop-stock /I'll do you one better:  #WHY IS A BUTTON?! Also WHY LET TWO COMPANIES YOU GREW UP ON DIE CAUSE OF SOME FUXBOIS? again WHY DO YOU CARE WHAT WE DO? >WHY GME NOT AT 10K yet????  Were it so easy... WHY THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT BEEN SQUOZE Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC.

TAKE ME TO THE 40'SS BABYYY IM FCKING LOADING UP !!

I worry that the pulling the IPO last year, re-educating Jack Ma, and some of the public sabre rattling in December was the CCP's way of saying they want a big cut.  I am still hodling my BABA shares, but have been disappointed that it is kind of stuck going sideways and always at the mercy of the CCP. So BABA puts? Hold on, so you're telling me you think investing in GME will bring down the entire market, and, give me a minute, you think that would be a good idea.   The thing is, I don't think you're wrong, but you should probably take into account the psychology- a very visible irrational GME number is telling everyone the market is unstable, freaking them out, and making them want to sell.   I however, just a piddly nobody with less than 30k in my 401k turned IRA cannot pull that shit off the market once I put in. I'm sure lots of brokeass people are in the same boat.  My point is, DEAR BABY JESUS STAHP."
GH,8,8387," HE DEFECATED THROUGH A SUNROOF THIS IS GOOD. THEY GAVE BONUSES SO HIGH LEVEL EMPLOYEE DOESNT SELL THEIR SHARES. IT PRESERVES STOCK VALUE!!!! DUH!!! I want to find out who y’all plug is...cuz you doing it, but you HiGH af!!!‼️ I have mad respect for all of you though!!  Balls, this world needs more of you youngsters to have them. Shorts have been suppressing the price for months, genius move on the part of RKT management to smash them with the $1.10 divi.   New money will come in leading up to March 9th, finally breaking us out of this resistance at $24.  Shorts will also have to pay divi out of pocket (fuck em) AND a squeeze should be triggered as they scramble to cover. HOW HIGH WILL IT GO!? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAA COUGH COUGH COOOOOOUGHHHHHH COUGGGGU COUGH COUGH...cough. WAIT IF YOU'RE GONNA ACTUALLY LOOK INTO IT I WAS HIGH LAST NIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY #11 lol the scene is so perfect GME HIGH OF $403 TODAY ACCORDING TO NASDAQ Courtesy of u/brawnerboy  I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https: www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)  If you haven't already, you should read it.  Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.  Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90  &#x200B;  Edit: This is not financial advice I am retarded but I like this stock  Edit: As of 3:15 today the short interest has increased from 38% to 81%"
NEE,8,2360," OPEN THE CASINO I NEED TO BE RETARDED W MY HARD EARNED MONEY YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BADLY I NEEDED TO SEE THIS!! THAT GUY NEEDS TO RELOCATE IMMEDIATELY. SHHHHIIIITTTT. 😬😳👀😁😁😁. That’s an old video LOW KEY , now I NEED chicken nugs !!! 😭 Been seeing a lot of comments in the past few days, “What’re the chances this is actually going to work?”-esq questions. Look, I’m not going to make you wrong for asking these types of questions because they are rational questions - but WSB wasn’t founded on rationality - it was founded on YOLOing our children’s college funds away and making memes about it. This is a MOONSHOT; not a sure bet - if you can’t handle the fire get out of the kitchen (aka sub to r/investing and get a nice safe index fund).  Here are the facts -> They NEED our shares. We are seeing them BLATANTLY use every trick in the book (naked shorts, keeping prices artificially low, blocking trading, etc) - in fact, they’re not even pretending or hiding it anymore. It’s out in the public - anyone who cares to see it can see it. But here’s the thing: despite all their tricks, at the end of the day - they still NEED our shares. At this point, it is a battle of attrition; they can only keep up their charade for so long before they literally have nothing left to short and they have to buy back their shorted positions (side note: I’m a retard and this prob isn’t exactly how it works but close enough so just fucking go with it for now). By holding (think Articuno chilling in cave [Seafoam Island] status) we lose NOTHING. If people keep buying/selling back and forth, it is playing into their hand. They want us to get bored and sell - behind all their dirty tricks, it sums up to them just trying to get us to sell - either through fear or boredom. Do what you got to do - but I am holding until the bitter fucking end.  Tldr; don’t get fatigue/boredom/fear from this - that’s what they want. Take time away and come back fresh. And most importantly - HOLD  Edit: Include specific location of Articuno’s YOLO spot  Edit 2: change “short ladder attack” to “keep prices artificially low” herp derp So I read WSB MOONDHOT NEED BLATANTLY NEED NOTHING HOLD YOLO  what did you guys see Sos!! NEEDS WSB HELP! Lying Hidenburg crooks!!! mmm I don’t NEEED others to decide FOR me. Im simply asking an honest question:  is it TOO LATE or not??? I will ultimately make a decision for myself come monday morning at 9:29AM EST"
TLRY,8,29," Buying more APHA and TLRY. Weed stocks going to FLY this month 🚀🚀🌙 So APHA or TLRY? Shorting has its merits, but in my opinion there needs to be transparency as well as a hard cap on the % of float that can be shorted. Shorting is too easy for the hedgies to use and abuse which they can and do at will with enough volume to have a noticeably negative impact. They don’t usually do it because of the fundamentals, but for profit. It’s bullshit what they can do to a stock - screwing over honest ppl who actually believe in the stock they invested in by shorting it to increase their profitability. Apple is the most valuable company in the world. They had a great earnings call this month. No reason to lose over 10 bucks of share in value like they have. I saw SAVA and TLRY shoot up in value and close at I think 117 and 65 or so respectively one day. Why? So higher OTM options are rolled out the next day. What happens the next day? Price falls by 50% rendering those OTM calls useless. First time GME shot to 150 - they were allowed to because they stopped shorting for a brief period. Why? To have any limit sells trigger in the 100-150 range and that day 150 was the highest OTM call option available. Shenanigans!! Thank god APHA and TLRY aren’t on there....now maybe we can make some money $APHA shareholders stand to gain “free money” via the gap when the $TLRY deal closes 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Aphria $APHA cultivates and sells medical and recreational cannabis through retail and wholesale channels in Canada and internationally.     🚀 On Dec. 16, Aphria and Tilray $TLRY announced a merger to form the largest cannabis company in the worldby revenue. The company will keep the Tilray name, including the ability to consolidate production in Canada, combine alcohol and CBD businesses in the United States in preparation for potential federal legalization, and the ability to combine efforts in Europe.    🚀 In a reverse merger structure, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share, implying a 23% premium to Tilray’s share price before the announcement. Given relative sizes, Aphria shareholders will own about 60% of the combined company and get seven of the nine board seats. Tilray CEO and Chairman Brendan Kennedy will get one of Tilray’s two board seats, while Aphria CEO and Chairman Irwin Simon will keep both roles in the combined company.    🚀 Its pending merger with Tilray boosts its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Deal terms seem fair to both sides. Aphria added recreational cannabis after Canada’s legalization in October 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Aphria’s recreational and wholesale cannabis revenue accounted for roughly 41% of total cannabis and distribution revenue. Unlike many of Aphria’s competitors that immediately focused on creating consumer packaged goods for the recreational market, Aphria initially focused on flower and vape. However, it is now beginning to expand into edibles.    🚀 On Feb. 1, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Ron Wyden announced their intentions to push major federal cannabis legislation. They plan to release a discussion draft in the early part of this year. Legalization is likely going to take a couple of years, as forecasts estimate a change to federal law by 2023. Nevertheless, legalization sooner than that would unlock growth and capital access sooner but doesn’t change our estimated market potential of $85 billion by 2030 compared with an estimated $15 billion in 2020, according to the Marijuana Business Daily.    🚀 Aphria has an extensive international distribution business, which generated the majority of net revenue in 2020, a far larger portion than many of its Canadian cannabis peers. The global market looks lucrative given higher realized prices and growing acceptance of the medical benefits of cannabis. Exportersbmust pass strict regulations to enter markets, which protects early entrants like Aphria. Due to climate, much of Canada’s cultivation is in greenhouses or indoors. Recent expansions in outdoor production are likely limited to extracted products due to quality. Aphria revised plans to build production in Colombia due to high capital costs, instead exporting global medical markets from its Canadian facilities.     🚀 Forecast estimate roughly 16% average annual growth through 2030 for the global medicinal market excluding Canada and the U.S. Aphria's 2020 acquisition of SweetWater, a U.S. craft brewery, still leaves it out of the U.S. THC or CBD market. Its strategy appears to predict that future cannabis distribution looks more like alcohol or tobacco than the current multi-state operator strucure of today. The U.S. offers the fastest growth of any market globally. However, the regulatory environment is murky with individual states legalizing cannabis while it remains illegal federally.  Federal law will eventually be changed to allow states to choose the legality of cannabis within their borders.    TLDR;;  🚀🚀🚀🚀 Aphria's merger with Tilray grows its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Aphria’s focus on strategic SG&A spending and running a lean business model allows it to have a healthy cash balance to fund future operations and investments. Aphria's careful approach to expansion has allowed it to reach profitability faster than any of its Canadian peers. This only makes sense if the gap remains consistent at the moment when shares are converted. Over the past couple of weeks, the gap between APHA and TLRY has been decreasing. Another thing to keep in mind is that when the conversion occurs, new shares will be introduced to TLRY, thus lowering the overall price of the stock. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD. This. And won’t it dilute the TLRY shares? Making the merger a pretty 1:1 transition for shareholders?"

See, I knew he's FROM OUT THERE!!! Here to liberate. # 🐸 is getting ready to leap.  This is my first DD post so I would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions I am making here. But I thing that JFrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why.  # What do they do?  Their main product is JFrog Artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries (runnable code) and it also serves as a mirror repository - local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer JFrog X-Ray that scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities). This is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory, Artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator, with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock, with X-Ray it also helps to ensure food safety.  **You may have heard of the Solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack. In my professional opinion, the toolset JFrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security.** That is why I am very much a Bullfrog 🐂🐸. If there is interest, I will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one, this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very, very well going forward.  # Company background  They were founded in 2008 and there main product has been Artifactory ever since. It has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope, Sonatype Nexus, but Artifactory is better and cheaper. Sonatype started as a plugin for Artifactory that does something similar to X-Ray before X-Ray existed, then they copycatted the Universal Repo, so JFrog hit back with X-Ray. I have used both of these products over the years (since 2013) and I have worked in environments without, Artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company Intellectual Property.  Their product is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook. These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe**. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have over 90% renewal rate of their customers.  They acquired Shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory. Though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are Open Source.  Their focus lately has been on offering a SaaS model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier. This should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic.  They went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as Snowflake.  # Financials  I am including a couple of Comps here based on the segment they operate in. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software Team collaboration. I picked them as a comp because I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.  * As a high growth software company, unsurprisingly their GAAP earnings are negative. Surprisingly to me though, they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability.    * FROG: -$0.1861    * CRWD: -$0.4763    * TEAM: -$4.9355 * Their market cap    * FROG: $4.9 B    * CRWD: $47.8 B    * TEAM: $59.4 B * Their forward P/E Ratio    * FROG: 615    * CRWD: 771    * TEAM: 173 * They don’t have any long term debt * Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3 * Their margin is over 80% * Revenue is growing 44% YOY  # Ownership  65% owned by insiders and institutions  Most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Index Fund) that own it.  Their final lockup was just released on 2/16 after their earnings and insiders have through 3/13 to sell before they go back into lockup. This is similar to what happened with Palantir recently, but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell.  # TL;DR  They have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry. They are well managed and have good financials as well.  # Positions  420 shares and 61 options, I am planning to get 8 more options on Monday. If you haven't guessed yet, I like the stock. You can check my post history to see some YOLO posts from earlier this week. I will post another update when I am fully loaded with 420/69 to ride this 🚀  My EOY price target is at least $100/share from the current price which is at $53.49 on Friday.  # Fun Frog Fact  In 1992 Frogs were the first vertebrates to have sex in space.  &#x200B;  # Sources  The company's website  [https: jfrog.com](https: jfrog.com)  For research on financials I have used the Shwab's site, but you need to be a customer to access.

A few choice words tell you the Fed is committed to 2% YoY inflation in the *long term* ... and we’ve had pretty low inflation the last few years...   They also revised their policy on max unemployment, saying they’re going to adjust monetary policy in reaction to how far BELOW max employment we are, instead of the traditional view of reaction to how far FROM max employment we are. Meaning inflation is fine by JPOW **in the short term**. Take that how you will.   VNQ 90c Jan 2021 Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"

Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.  This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).  It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.  There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.  AMC has A LOT MORE: [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.  BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.  NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.  Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).

The last 4 days we have seen Short volume as a percent of total volume between 58-62%. During the last jump in price, we saw between 32-54%, so as a percent of daily volume, the shorts are even HIGHER than last time!  EDIT: Thank you u/RicFlairsCape \- correct about the volume being total volume, not total shorts. i have updated the formula, looking at total short volume executed. Agree we don't know if it is all new positions or not, but the volume increase of acted shorts is in line with what we saw last time.  My fellow apes!  boilerplate: i know nothing, i can't do math good. don't listen to me  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see a increase in short volume over the last 2 days!

This is literally IDENTICAL to the volume we say on Jan 21 & 22 (11M & 33M) just before the price jumped."

BORR,8,16512," Hey folks! I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.  Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:  So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101). I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:     TL;DR: You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.    Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic. Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:  you start with ~0~ shares you borrow one from a broker you now have ~1~ shares you sell that share, completing your short you now have ~0~ shares  Now imagine the short squeeze happens. And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc. The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).  Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high: Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital.  You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.  you start with ~0~ shares you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker! you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!  Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with!  Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value:   THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?  Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy. Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.   If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations. Now think about that again.   Effective TL;DR 2.0:  People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule? Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.  But here’s MY question: What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it?  VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.   Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not. Joy to all, ~Unimportant   (this is not financial advise, and I am not a financial advisor)  I heard the SHORTS CAN'T BORROW YOUR SHARES TO SHORT IF YOU DO THE FOLLOWING. 1.

BECAUSE THERE IS A PENDING ORDER ON THOSE SHARES YOUR BROKERS CAN'T LEND THEM OUT! Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
OI,8,94," You do understand that even if someone sold naked calls they can and do roll them to the next week and up a strike price or two for a credit.  I do it all the time.  I had some GME (they are covered calls) $60C from this past Friday I rolled out a week and up to $68C for a small Credit to me.  House tends to win. When I roll them out the OI on those calls decreases because me as the writer am effectively taking those calls out of the pool by writing new ones for the next Friday. Yeah well he also said the whole system could have crashed if they didn’t stop buying because there were options for “150M shares” bought and only 50M shares out.  1) I checked. OI on 1/27 and 1/28 totaled 150k and 100K (10M and 15M shares) respectively. Which is a sht ton on a stock with 50M float but it’s not 3x the float 2) GME closed Friday 1/29 at $325 meaning a ton of options were ITM. And yet... here we still are. Did GME get massively squeezed the next week? No. Did the financial system crumble? No.  So what he said makes no sense. I get that he’s the founder of IBKR and worth $20B and I’m an idiot on Reddit but the way everyone bought his explanation is wild. Anyone stop to consider he had an interest in over exaggerating the situation to explain why IKBr couldn’t meet collateral requirements? The market is way more dynamic than what you understand.  There is a very small probability that the options you are trading are from 18 months ago.  Many are from a week or two ago.  Even if someone were to sell a LEAP 18 mths out you don't think some of them bought them back when the price bottomed at $38 a couple weeks ago on GME and reduced the OI.  The volume of the underlying stock is driving incrementally more options sales.  These options are new and the OI is constantly going up and down. Wouldn't surprise me if big money was selling a bunch of naked calls on a big spike and then buying them back on a dip for 20 to 25% profit in minutes or hours.  I sold a bunch of AMC Calls for $17 next Friday when it spiked to over $10.  If I want to I could have already bought them back for 30 to 40% profit and reduce the OI  on my calls.  I am holding because I don't think it will hit and stay above $17 by Friday.  I had some calls I sold last week at $7 that I rolled up to $8 and out a week for a credit. All mine are covered by shares but wouldn't have to be if I had enough capital and options level 4. Your mention of loaning crazy DTI ratios in 2008 paralells the nearly 10 fold increase we've seen in GME shorting fees over the past week. It would seem that if your borrowing costs rose 10 fold you'd move to other investments... but we are seeing nearly the opposite.   My other scattered thoughts are below, curious to know what you think.   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In my opinion we do not currently have accurate short interest numbers, and perhaps never did considering all the potential ways to disguise it. As soon as hedgies knew we relied on that number, it ceased to become a reliable metric.   We all saw Melvin Capital lie about closing their positions pre-squeeze, we all saw CNBC try to divert us with SLV, and we all heard the IB president said if more of those calls were exercised on the 27th/28th it would've crashed everything. We didn't see short fees this high back then, nor did we see no available shares to short like we did on the 25th.  If this blows up we all know the effects it could have on the greater system, and for this reason hedgies are doubling down. In their mind they win both ways, either profiting off shorts by manipulating us all to sell, or getting bailed out by the govt if it all blows up.  Looking at upcoming option contracts: every single expiry has more puts than calls (OI).   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.  Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.  &#x200B;  Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. They tried this last week and failed, and the fight must continue if the squeeze is to be squoze. if you have a real broker, you should be able to see stats like open interest (OI) and volume for individual options as well as options time and sales. if your broker doesnt, you can see stats in yahoo finance. if volume on a given contract us greater than OI, thats a sign people are expecting and betting on movement above that strike price. if you see large amounts of calls being bought up at a strike near the current price and date to expiration is short, that could be a sign to buy and play momentum on the way up. as more and more strikes become ITM, MMs have to buy in anticipation to cover their position and deliver shares if they are exercised, thus driving the price up and shorts buy up to cap losses, adding fuel to the price. Calls are your friend in this situation as retards buying and holding 5-10 shares at the top isn’t going to do anything. we haven’t see a true short squeeze, just two gamma squeezes with shorts covering on the way up. timing is everything. keep an eye on things that may seem unusual, but be rational. someone buying 1000 $800c is not really going to do anything, but large amounts of say $125c expiring this coming friday could be something. just be smart, dont chase, and know when to sell. its easy to say diamond hands when you bought at the top, but if you’re staring 1000% gains in the face, take profit He's capitalizing off hype and his friendly trustworthy-appearing persona. This is not to mention that every option expiry has more put IO than call OI, which directly conflicts his theory. Call volume is not a useful indicator, it just means a lot of call OI is changing hands back and forth. Next week has put OI of 87,259 and call OI of 65,041.   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.   Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.   Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. Yes you are right! But last week, they also hoped for decreased price but it closed over 100 and the OI in ITM calls ended significantly higher than the OI in ITM puts  They always had plans for the GME price to decrease and that s why they lost this one and maybe the next one"
BIL,7,124," I lost it when the announcer said ""HE'S A BILLIONAIRE AND HE OWNS THIS COMPANY!"" How can you honestly believe 100K or even 50K is possible?  If it got anywhere close to that level you are talking market cap of TRILLIONS of dollars, higher than the GDP of the USA, about on par with the total value of the entire market.  Even if it somehow magically inflated to this level, do you really think any of us would actually see any of it, they are going to somehow be able to just start handing BILLIONS of dollars to the average investor? I’m all in as well but seeing the disconnect from reality in some of these posts is just mind blowing to me. Check the penalty for lying under oath and bail requirements. Maximum probably at 10-20 Million. They lost how much last time? 70 BILLION If you sell we loose, so we loose because you have  Bills to pay BUT EVERYONE OF US HAVE TO PAY BILLS TOO AND WERE NOT SELLING Instruction unclear, bought BILI. It’s simple.  They lent money to people on margin trades to short these stocks and their own clients could not cover their own margin calls.  When the clients cannot cover and default, RH is on the hook to cover for them. RH didn’t have the money to do that since all their clients with smooth brains were buying their hearts out.   RH was being forced to cover for defaulting clients in short positions by going to the exchanges and getting more shares to use internally off the market.  This was breaking their backs.  Remember, GME peaked at $2900 for some RH clients.  That puts GME 70million shares at 203 BILLION dollars value.  RH was going to end up defaulting to citadel, which would have defaulted to the clearing house, which would have forced citadel to liquidate literally everything.    TL:DR buy and hold Position 1GME at $45, Monday all in now that RH is in E*TRADE. **First, I am not a financial analyst or am I here to advise on what to do, here to just share my personal insights for discussion/entertainment purposes only. I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

Lot of fucked up obvious shit going on with this ONE stock(maybe amc too i dunno) YES *** DAMN IT YES! THAT IS RIGHT I DID IT!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!  THATS RIGHT!  WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE??

How bout you lower ticket prices or give away some gift cards for when you reopen??? How about you save the money for when you fall on hard times...LIKE YOU ARE IN RIGHT NOW?! What do you expect, the worthless shares skyrocketed. You don’t think they were selling shares from the treasury for his bonus? They all know the game better than any of us ever will. They were jumping up and down , high-five’ ing each other at the fact they got one last run out of a broken company that as much as I hate to say THE SHORTS WERE RIGHT. It’s still a pig but now someone put a little lipstick on it. Dumping it RIGHT into the $RKT squeeze! Worst case I collect the free 5% dividend payout, best case TENDIES ON THE MOON  Not a bot, not financial advice Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
UGE,7,18925," I got HUGE negative gains. Dude, you know it’s not going to $100k or $10k, come on. Would be a HUGE win to make it to $1k. Even if it got back to $500 a huge number of people would sell. He probably didn’t give them a reason. Two things probably triggered this:  1. His contract may contain a clause that includes “incentive compensation” to tie a bonus payout to company performance, measured in a number of different ways (profit/loss, year over year comps, share price, etc) - this probably would not be a retention scenario.  2. Board potentially decided that with retail traders supporting them, the best thing AMC can do is “not mess it up.” That means steady - don’t rock the boat. CEO leaving is a HUGE red flag for investors and would basically take this “lifeline” that retail investors have given them, and throw it away. This could likely be the case and may be a “proactive” retention scenario.  I would also suspect that a number of other employees are also receiving bonuses, but we heard about the CEO’s because (1) the number is biggest and (2) it makes for a ripe news story for people who want to be angry. Single HUGE trades at or within 1 min of closing at the closing price is not a real trade. It's a bin that all trades which occurred during the day but didn't end up in the book are thrown into. E.g. I buy 5k at 10am for $120, something (I'm not an expert, someone can elaborate on this) prevents that 5k order from making it to the book, it gets lumped into this I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.  By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.  Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/  First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!!   Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink.   Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here.   By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.  Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.  When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.  UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!  Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.  Space Ape out  TLDR:   * $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU * $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI * $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot * $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds * $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon  EDIT: Fresh data in.... Added Wendys and the 100k moon prediction People don't seem to fully appreciate HOW many options are VERY CLOSE to being in the money expiring today. As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will. Remember each 1 option = 100 shares.  Sort by VOLUME  $GME   [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme)   29,097 contracts @ $800   10,905 contracts @ $200   10,418 contracts @ $150  This is HUGE volume. If the stock closes at $150 it can cause a chain reaction.  $BB   [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb)   6,665 contracts @ $11   2,483 contracts @ $12   1,692 contracts @ $10.50  $AMC   [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?p=amc](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?p=amc)   43,493 contracts @ $8 - WOW!   27,299 contracts @ $9   26,471 contracts @ $10  They can't let the price above $8!  $NOK   [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok)   4,064 contracts $4   3,417 contracts $4.50  &#x200B;  EDIT 1 @ 4:30PM:   **AMC closed at $8.01 AH $8.04**   **NOK closed at $3.92 AH $3.94**   **GME closed at $101.74 AH $100.55**   **BB  closed $10.05 AH $10.03**  Option holders have until 5:30PM to exercise any ITM options. Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.  This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).  It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.  There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.  AMC has A LOT MORE: [https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc](https: finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.  BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.  NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.  Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).  Everyone have a great weekend.  Disclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only. Do your own research. Not financial advice. Eat crayons.     EDIT 2: fucked formatting Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
NEV,7,6397," This gamma squeeze will cause the short cover which will result in the MOTHER OF ALL SQUEEZES  THERE MAY NEVER BE ANOTHER SQUEEZE LIKE GME EVER *Me trying to figure out how to set a sell order*  BUT I CANT FIGURE OUT OUT CAUSE I HAVE NEVER TRADED BEFORE  Fuck it  Hold Yes and no.  There’s some onus on you to not make trades you shouldn’t.  Double entering an order without confirmation of a cancellation is a big no no, on any platform.  NEVER assume an order disappeared.  The client-broker relationship is a “we have a big sandbox and a lot of power, we are going to give you a corner to yourself and the power to do just about anything, use it wisely.  If you put us at too much risk we may restrict you.” Price will be going to go down Monday/Tuesday shorts have to pay the premium. So they will try to push it down so they won’t have to pay as much. You will see low 7’s buy buy buy. The real action won’t start till Thursday/ Friday. The stock is great no matter what theaters are opening and the stock will grow, you will not lose anything under $8 is a steal. Be patient. TRADing is all timing. NEVER GET EMOTIONAL OVER A STOCK, you lose when you have FOMO. So buy in the next 2 days. Good luck Paper hands: "" This battle is over"" Diamond hand:""This battle is over when i say it is over...🦍 prepare for glory."" Paper hand: ""  Glory? Have u gone mad? There is no glory to be had now, only a surrender or retreat or death!"" Diamond hand:"" Well thats an easy choice for us, paper hand. 🦍 NEVER RETREAT. 🦍 NEVER SURRENDER!"" You will NEVER find it... that‘s just how it is. Believe it or not, but finding the perfect entry and perfect exit point is pure luck.  So you can wait and hope for GME to dip some more so you can buy in more cheaply, but chances are at least as high that it takes off soon 🚀🚀🚀 and you missed your chance - thinking „I wish I bought in @100 rather than @250+.“  What you learn from that? Well assuming you believe that GME has a solid chance of reaching 1‘000$ and more, it simply does not matter whether your entry point was @100 or @80 or @150.  Tldr: You will not find it, so just BUY while it still is in the 2-3 digit range (Edit: given that you believe in this rocket)! 🚀🚀🚀🚀  Obligatory: This is not financial advice, just my personal opinion and I like the stock. Biden will NEVER support nuclear energy. The hippies and Harris have him by the balls."
APHA,7,23," Buying more APHA and TLRY. Weed stocks going to FLY this month 🚀🚀🌙 So APHA or TLRY? Thank god APHA and TLRY aren’t on there....now maybe we can make some money I still like the GME stock but it seems to be an orchestrated dead cat bounce to get retail to FOMO in. Take a look at WSB and it clearly worked. It'll probably happen 2-3 more times in the future because people will bet the farm that GME goes up another 100-800% (and they would probably diamond hand for more because infinity gazillion is not a meme). Meanwhile, RKT is straight up free tendies with no downside risk. My prediction is that when RKT lands on the moon, the 7,000,000 new WSB members will FOMO in at the last minute (see Tilray, APHA, GME, AMC, NOK, BB, PLTR, etc...), and be stuck with the bag again. Then they will hate on whatever the next best play is before FOMOing into the top again. $APHA shareholders stand to gain “free money” via the gap when the $TLRY deal closes 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Aphria $APHA cultivates and sells medical and recreational cannabis through retail and wholesale channels in Canada and internationally.     🚀 On Dec. 16, Aphria and Tilray $TLRY announced a merger to form the largest cannabis company in the worldby revenue. The company will keep the Tilray name, including the ability to consolidate production in Canada, combine alcohol and CBD businesses in the United States in preparation for potential federal legalization, and the ability to combine efforts in Europe.    🚀 In a reverse merger structure, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share, implying a 23% premium to Tilray’s share price before the announcement. Given relative sizes, Aphria shareholders will own about 60% of the combined company and get seven of the nine board seats. Tilray CEO and Chairman Brendan Kennedy will get one of Tilray’s two board seats, while Aphria CEO and Chairman Irwin Simon will keep both roles in the combined company.    🚀 Its pending merger with Tilray boosts its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Deal terms seem fair to both sides. Aphria added recreational cannabis after Canada’s legalization in October 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Aphria’s recreational and wholesale cannabis revenue accounted for roughly 41% of total cannabis and distribution revenue. Unlike many of Aphria’s competitors that immediately focused on creating consumer packaged goods for the recreational market, Aphria initially focused on flower and vape. However, it is now beginning to expand into edibles.    🚀 On Feb. 1, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Ron Wyden announced their intentions to push major federal cannabis legislation. They plan to release a discussion draft in the early part of this year. Legalization is likely going to take a couple of years, as forecasts estimate a change to federal law by 2023. Nevertheless, legalization sooner than that would unlock growth and capital access sooner but doesn’t change our estimated market potential of $85 billion by 2030 compared with an estimated $15 billion in 2020, according to the Marijuana Business Daily.    🚀 Aphria has an extensive international distribution business, which generated the majority of net revenue in 2020, a far larger portion than many of its Canadian cannabis peers. The global market looks lucrative given higher realized prices and growing acceptance of the medical benefits of cannabis. Exportersbmust pass strict regulations to enter markets, which protects early entrants like Aphria. Due to climate, much of Canada’s cultivation is in greenhouses or indoors. Recent expansions in outdoor production are likely limited to extracted products due to quality. Aphria revised plans to build production in Colombia due to high capital costs, instead exporting global medical markets from its Canadian facilities.     🚀 Forecast estimate roughly 16% average annual growth through 2030 for the global medicinal market excluding Canada and the U.S. Aphria's 2020 acquisition of SweetWater, a U.S. craft brewery, still leaves it out of the U.S. THC or CBD market. Its strategy appears to predict that future cannabis distribution looks more like alcohol or tobacco than the current multi-state operator strucure of today. The U.S. offers the fastest growth of any market globally. However, the regulatory environment is murky with individual states legalizing cannabis while it remains illegal federally.  Federal law will eventually be changed to allow states to choose the legality of cannabis within their borders.    TLDR;;  🚀🚀🚀🚀 Aphria's merger with Tilray grows its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Aphria’s focus on strategic SG&A spending and running a lean business model allows it to have a healthy cash balance to fund future operations and investments. Aphria's careful approach to expansion has allowed it to reach profitability faster than any of its Canadian peers. This only makes sense if the gap remains consistent at the moment when shares are converted. Over the past couple of weeks, the gap between APHA and TLRY has been decreasing. Another thing to keep in mind is that when the conversion occurs, new shares will be introduced to TLRY, thus lowering the overall price of the stock. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD."

""I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE SELLING NAKED OPTIONS""  &#x200B;  lmao. jfc. On glitchy Tuesday, 26th I think, Schwab executed my sell to close 10 GME call contracts... twice. I had closed out positions on that account and went to review an hour later only to see I was NAKED short 10 calls of GME as we were squeezing. I had sold for $150 per call but when I saw the account was short the calls had reached $230! I bought to close to mitigate losses and called them.  1) I only have a level 2 option account, I literally can’t naked sell calls  2) you can’t sell to close the same options twice. You would need to sell to close then sell to open.  They eventually refunded the 80k in losses their system caused. I had double buy for NAK on TDA, I was pissed until I made 23k off of it the next week.  I'll pray for you. Hey folks! I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.  Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:  So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101). I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:     TL;DR: You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.    Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic. Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:  you start with ~0~ shares you borrow one from a broker you now have ~1~ shares you sell that share, completing your short you now have ~0~ shares  Now imagine the short squeeze happens. And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc. The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).  Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high: Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital.  You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.  you start with ~0~ shares you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker! you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!  Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with!  Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value:   THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?  Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy. Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.   If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations. Now think about that again.   Effective TL;DR 2.0:  People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule? Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.  But here’s MY question: What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it?  VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.   Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not. Joy to all, ~Unimportant   (this is not financial advise, and I am not a financial advisor) Ugh. I disagree with your logic a bit on the naked short part.   Yes the HF or whoever will have -1 and then go to 0, but they NAKED shorted. That means there is no brokerage etc who lent them the shares to begin with. So there isn't any further transaction ""required"" to close it out. They just absorb the share and the overall outstanding shares fall.    There isn't a functional difference in how the computers and exchanges treat manufactured shares vs. legitimate shares. Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"

Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down.

NEVER GET EMOTIONAL OVER A STOCK, you lose when you have FOMO. So buy in the next 2 days. Good luck Paper hands: "" This battle is over"" Diamond hand:""This battle is over when i say it is over...🦍 prepare for glory."" Paper hand: ""  Glory? Have u gone mad? There is no glory to be had now, only a surrender or retreat or death!"" Diamond hand:"" Well thats an easy choice for us, paper hand. 🦍 NEVER RETREAT. 🦍 NEVER SURRENDER!"" You will NEVER find it... that‘s just how it is. Believe it or not, but finding the perfect entry and perfect exit point is pure luck.  So you can wait and hope for GME to dip some more so you can buy in more cheaply, but chances are at least as high that it takes off soon 🚀🚀🚀 and you missed your chance - thinking „I wish I bought in @100 rather than @250+.“  What you learn from that? Well assuming you believe that GME has a solid chance of reaching 1‘000$ and more, it simply does not matter whether your entry point was @100 or @80 or @150.  Tldr: You will not find it, so just BUY while it still is in the 2-3 digit range (Edit: given that you believe in this rocket)! 🚀🚀🚀🚀  Obligatory: This is not financial advice, just my personal opinion and I like the stock.

JNJ,7,132," House passed the stimmy and FDA approved JNJ's vaccine. Good news after good news. In other words, massive plunge scheduled for Monday. stimmy talks going well and JNJ vaccine approved, what could go wrong this week We are trying to fuck with the algorithm right?? We’re into blue chips now. JNJ MCD T AAPL JNJ has approved , let roll![img](emote|wsb_emojis|bull) [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates See any activity on JNJ last week? With the vaccine news coming out could be a bagger I think The stock split, HK listing, and eventual EV is a lethal combo but you’re right, that’s only IF we can breathe some life into tech this week  With JNJ announcement that’s tenuous, though, but I’ll probably be betting on BIDU all the way down Lolol"

LEAP,7,69," The market is way more dynamic than what you understand.  There is a very small probability that the options you are trading are from 18 months ago.  Many are from a week or two ago.  Even if someone were to sell a LEAP 18 mths out you don't think some of them bought them back when the price bottomed at $38 a couple weeks ago on GME and reduced the OI.  The volume of the underlying stock is driving incrementally more options sales.  These options are new and the OI is constantly going up and down. Wouldn't surprise me if big money was selling a bunch of naked calls on a big spike and then buying them back on a dip for 20 to 25% profit in minutes or hours.  I sold a bunch of AMC Calls for $17 next Friday when it spiked to over $10.  If I want to I could have already bought them back for 30 to 40% profit and reduce the OI  on my calls.  I am holding because I don't think it will hit and stay above $17 by Friday.  I had some calls I sold last week at $7 that I rolled up to $8 and out a week for a credit. All mine are covered by shares but wouldn't have to be if I had enough capital and options level 4. You gotta diversify your bonds n\*\*\*\*!!!!

BAC,7,1807," AMEN BROTHER THAT WAS GOLD. ILL COME BACK WITH MY FREE AWARD LATER. SNDL IS THE WAY THEY HAVE ZERO DEBT & OVER $610M IN UNRESTRICTED CASH FROM RECENT CAPITAL RAISES READY TO SEE THIS TAKE OFF BACK & BEYOND $13 A SHARE  💸💰🤑🚀🤘👩‍🚀💎👐🌜🌎💯 IF IT DIPS BACK DOWN TO 50 OR BELOW iM BUYING MORE Hey folks! I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.  Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:  So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101). I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:     TL;DR: You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.    Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic. Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:  you start with ~0~ shares you borrow one from a broker you now have ~1~ shares you sell that share, completing your short you now have ~0~ shares  Now imagine the short squeeze happens. And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc. The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).  Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high: Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital.  You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.  you start with ~0~ shares you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker! you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!  Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with!  Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value:   THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?  Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy. Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.   If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations. Now think about that again.   Effective TL;DR 2.0:  People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule? Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.  But here’s MY question: What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it?  VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.   Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not. Joy to all, ~Unimportant   (this is not financial advise, and I am not a financial advisor) Stfu rly with 800 fucktards. 800 is srsly the fucking ezpz squeeze.

BE READY TO PUT UR MOONBOOTS ON CUZ GALAXIES ARS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS OP left out a buncha things. I think he ran out of crayons:   * The $1.11 special dividend is screwing  the shorts. If they own the stock til the dividend date, they have to pay the dividend to the folks they borrowed from. * RKT doesn't need the fucking money. They're profitable as fuck. They only did an IPO to allow insiders to have liquidity and/or acquire other companies. * Nearly all the time when a company is shorted, they expect it to lose money, or it's overpriced. Like I said, they don't need the money. However RKT did just have a huge 3rd quarter (and 2020) due to refinancings, so next year won't be as profitable. But they're still growing fast. * The lockup period for insiders to sell their stock came and went. No one sold, they know the stock is worth more.  * Main risk for a mortgage company is rising interest rates. The fed has said they'll [maintain the low rates until 2022](https: www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/fed-meeting-decision-interest-rates.html) * Because of the buyback program, the stock can't go down much. If it does, they'll BUY IT BACK. Stupid shorts, how are you going to make money if it the company will prevent it from going lower?  I personally think the special dividend was a FU to the shorts, and they'll start their buyback leading up to the dividend as a FU twice. So unlike GME we aren't relying on paper hands to squeeze the squoze. There's a billion dollars of squeezy-squeezy coming. We just don't know if it'll squeeze quick or slow.  Even if nothing happens, the likelihood of the stock going down is as small as your pecker in freezing ice cold water in the middle of winter. If you're going to try f'ing the big shorts, don't you want to practice safe sex?  I also like the stock. Will be holding long term anyway. They have really aggressive expansion plans which will pay off for years. Courtesy of u/brawnerboy  I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https: www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)  If you haven't already, you should read it.  Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.  Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90  &#x200B;  Edit: This is not financial advice I am retarded but I like this stock  Edit: As of 3:15 today the short interest has increased from 38% to 81%"

If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

Put it on $SPCE 🚀 $SPCE to the goddamned moon - ignore the pain and focus on this industry maker The past week has been fucking rough for us SPCE boys, but good things on the horizon. Bottom line the market doesn’t understand the space industry and how common multiple setbacks are. People not familiar with the space industry want things to happen and want them to happen now. I am very intimate with the space community and have many friends in the industry. The test flight delays overshadowed the strong points mentioned on the earnings call.  1. Comparison: In 2015, SpaceX’s valuation was 10.1B. Today they’re valued at 74B. Going off of market cap, which I know doesn’t represent the whole picture, Virgin is comparable at 9.9B. While SpaceX used government contracts to scale their business and Virgin is mostly focused on the commercial aspects, they are both ultimately trying to capture a similar market – pay for play astronauts. Let’s flash back to 2015, when SpaceX had a similar valuation to our dear $SPCE:  • June 28, 2015 – rocket vaporized  • September 1, 2016 – explosion on launch pad  Now imagine SpaceX being a public company at this point, it’s shares would have tanked. But smart investors (VC bubbas) didn’t panic. In November 2017 SpaceX raised a new round at a valuation of 21.3B – twice it’s valuation from 2 years before despite 2 very public failures with defense (their biggest customer!!) payloads on board. Virgin doesn’t have the comfort of having a few setbacks, because instead of 1B bloated defense satellites on board they have human lives. They have to do everything necessary to protect themselves from that – all while worrying about being a public company! No one remembers the multidude of Spacex failures from 2006-2015. They just see a stable service provider worth almost 75B and wish they could have invested in it. But if it was public, people would’ve been just as hesitant as they’re being with $SPCE today.  2) Leadership changes: Virgin has made it clear that their CFO was only staying on board to aid the transition from private to public. They had shit timing tbh by dropping the update on earning’s day, but this was expected. After the first full year as a traded company, the CFO parted ways to allow space for the fulltime executive. Additionally, they’ve added multiple former Disney executives to oversee their commercialization plan. This experience will have a huge positive impact when $SPCE delivers spaceflight to customers. Think of the combination of the Disney experience with your typical thrill-seeking events.  3) Spaceship 3: New space plane unveiled! I don’t know why everyone’s ignoring this. Virgin is expanding their fleet of servicing planes and improving their ability to provide a once in a lifetime experience to customers. This is coming on March 30 with testing this summer.  4) Financials: For those concerned with cash burn rate, chart mill fundamental analysis gives a current ratio of 6.81 and a quick ratio of 6.59 = no problem at all paying short term obligations. Altman Z score of 41.67 indicates no danger of bankruptcy. Yes they’re hurting, but we have nothing to compare it to. SpaceX was and is a private company who didn’t openly provide quarterly/annual financials. Think of this as creating an entire new industry, straight from Peter Thiel’s Zero to One. This is the stock that can make you a fortune. Just think of parallels you can draw. My mind goes to Tesla, who didn’t have a profitable year for their first 18 years as a company, yet still held a market cap of 100B in January 2020 based on excitement alone (2020 ended up being their first profitable year) – now has >6x’ed.  RECAP: I’m loading up on $SPCE. Come Monday I’m loading up on April calls (to take advantage of March SpaceShip 3 release) and June calls (for May test flight). Sure, come at me with the comparisons to SpaceX and Tesla, I DGAF. People cream at the idea of Elon leading a venture, well guess what Richard Branson was and has always been the epitome of a charismatic founder. All the Elon fanboys should be as hot and heavy about Branson as they are about Elon. Let him make you rich. Use your smooth silky brain to make a good choice and fucking buy $SPCE.  You do you, this isn’t financial advice I just love the stock. Loading up Monday on SPCE and GME. GME might not make me that many tendies (late to the game) but SPCE sure will. LFG"
NVDA,7,221," [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.

[They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).

[ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.

All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates Lisa Su CEO of AMD purchased XLNX back in Oct. 2020 for 35B in cash since then the deal has been killed off, then back on and now it’s going through review.   With any month now AMD and XLNX will merge completely under on ticker adding to AMD share price.   AMD is a semiconductor chip manufacturer for Gaming consoles, laptops, cars, and basically anything under the sun that needs a processor(CPU or GPU).   With a chip shortage at hand AMD is in the lead of the semi conductor industry increasing profit margins and also leading in stock increase of 45% compared to NVDA 35% and INTL up 8%.   Chip shortage is to be solved once AMD releases and showcases their new Radeon RX 6000 GPU (Radeon RX 6700 Series) March 3 this is to give an alternative option NVDA’s unit GeForce RTX 3060.   Lisa Su plans to tackle cars,computers,solar panels, to help end the semiconductor shortage (Biden executive order that gives Semiconductor companies and their suppliers 47B to ramp up production for semiconductor companies to create vast amounts of semiconductors.)  AMD 110c 6/18 PT 128$ that would make market cap 154.9B  ""Chip shortage is to be solved once AMD releases and showcases their new Radeon RX 6000 GPU (Radeon RX 6700 Series) March 3 this is to give an alternative option NVDA’s unit GeForce RTX 3060""  I hope you realize AMD does not actually manufacture semiconductors.  TSM makes them for AMD.  AMD has zero influence on the supply of semiconductors. Also TSM is now prioritizing auto manufacturers chips over the general pc wafers. I think AMD NVDA UMC AMBA and the like will be doing well over the next few years. if NVDA sees doing 5B in revenue this same quarter AMD will be able to do atleast 4 if not 4.2B Not really. Can't find a line of reasoning in the incoherent blabbering in OPs post. But he is bullish on AMD, as am I. Buy this dip. AMD is the underdog taking more space from INTC last years. Trying to mess with NVDA market share too. NVDA isn't a foundary.  I'm considering TSM, INTC, and maybe MU."
OVID,7,5738," Why would anyone sell at $15-20? As the pandemic lessens and AMC opens up more and more GLOBALLY, not just in the US, this stock will easily rebound to $25 and pre-COVID levels by summer I think...assuming no squeeze or buyout. With all of the pent up demand, even if you take the short squeeze or Amazon out of the picture, I don’t think it would be unreasonable to see AMC hit all time highs or $40 range by EOY. My prediction is we will see some type of squeeze or a buyout in the next few months though. Definitely holding until something big happens. Yep 33 days and the truth hurts. I’m all for making a quick dollar but a lot of you guys miss lead young people into losing the life savings to make a dollar for your self. (Wolf of Wall Street) I have lost a dime in the whole GME/AMC/SNDL thing that has happened but I’ve heard about and it’s sad. For starters game stop as a business is crap. All the kids that probably lost there money in the market are the same kids that got ripped by the stores. They ones who have made out are the CEO and other officers that had free stock given to them... not you guys. And all you did was make a group of shit head CEO’s richer..if they wanted to fix the company they would have rolled there gains into making it a better company and not calling it quits. Mind you I have lost a dime... never bought a single share. So I have nothing invested in it. I have putts that AMC drops but that’s the inevitable. Netflix and HBO max are gonna put them out of business anyways. Nobody goes to the theater anymore pre COVID they didn’t either, unless it was Star Wars movies. All of you know I’m right. I’m glad some of you have gain a lot but remember that when you win someone else will lose and some day you will be on the losing end. Well said. I can agree with the long term. If the chewy guy can keep it moving, how ever do remember that video game market is mostly kids using birthday and Christmas money to purchase games. Cant use cash to purchase a download. And chewy was only successful because of COVID and once that’s over people are gonna quit using it and go back to the stores like Petco and pet smart, so store like Walmart and bestbuy will snuff out game stop in the future. Just like Walmart will eventually snuff out Amazon and GM and Ford will snuff out Tesla. Unless Elon does that first him self.. Why are you angry about that? that is a teeny tiny bonus in CEO-land and AMC looks like it's going to survive COVID now thanks converting their debt to shares. In the face of an unpredictable catastrophy, somehow AMC pulled though.  If you wanna get pissed off check out some bonuses for the CEOs of airlines. A Republican Paul Gosar introduced an amendment to give us all 10K checks and redirect the funding for everything not COVID related back to the people and cut out all the special interest spending and foreign aid. The democrats promptly shut it down. But it doesn’t have cinemas though - and post COVID people will want to leave their houses for it 💎🙌🦍here. I wrote some basic advice I'll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action, or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper-handing. Paper-handing is fundamentally bad investment practice, especially if you're a new investor. I'll explain why.  *DISLAIMER: I've only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff, and he hasn’t steered me wrong yet. So take it for what it’s worth... But based on all the fact that paper-handing is even an issue here, you apes clearly need this advice.* ***EDIT: These are ""fundamentals"" to the way I trade, but obviously everyone's trading strategy is different. Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing, which doesn't encourage YOLO-ing. This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to ""outsmart"" the general public by spotting opportunities/value before the market does. I feel it's particularly relevant to the GME play. The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it. There are other approaches (which often require more experience) but I feel this is most accessible to new investors. GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything. Well, everything that you don’t think will go bankrupt or get delisted.***  **New traders, or people who are thinking of becoming new traders, should read this.** Especially if you're new, I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market. This applies to all stock, not just GME. If you're experienced, it might just sound like I'm explaining at length why 2 + 2 = 4, but since a friend of a friend told me he paper-handed on GME (sold the dip), I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea.  **I would encourage people to buy GME, but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while.** (edit: in addition, just to reiterate, keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down) By this I mean **NEVER SELL AT A LOSS**. Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down. All newbie investors (IMO) should adhere to this rule just in general. Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground, or don’t buy it at all.  Many investors, myself included, follow this rule religiously, not just with GME but with all stocks. I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss, I just held or bought more. COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out? I just held and was fine... should have bought more. If everyone bought into GME with this mindset, I bet it would go to Pluto easily.  If you sell at a loss, you are donating to the ""save the short sellers"" fund out of your own wallet, fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes, and you’re not even following sound investment practice. Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy. If you’re thinking of investing so much that you’ll wuss out, poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red... just don’t. Emotion and the stock market do not mix well.  Stop losses (below purchase price) are also for pansies and genuine idiots. “I’ll sell you some stock... but only if you give me a bad enough price on it.” Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down... if you feel like you need a stop loss, you're investing more than you should. Instead of being stupid, maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips.  Side note: personally, in the case of GME, I don’t have any limit sells either. From what I can tell on past short squeezes, the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down. So as long as you keep an eye on GME when it actually does skyrocket, you should have plenty of time. Set price alerts and relax. No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid-launch.  Although, if you want you can try to profit off GME volatility. Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I'm not sure they deserve it. As far as I know, buying low and selling high doesn’t really help HFs, it drives the price up (just not as much as buying and holding). But personally, my philosophy is, I can take baby profits anytime... who knows when something like this GME rise will happen again. So I’m holding (101 shares at cost average $106/share).  Want to get into the game now? You could always just buy a few shares, and keep the rest of what you’re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip. And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more, bringing your cost average down. Ideally, you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero. Always try to keep cash in reserve.  Locked yourself in at a high price? That's why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down. Didn't keep any cash in reserve? Guess you're stuck waiting for one of three things: 1) the short squeeze which will likely (though not certainly) happen, 2) for the price of GME to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases, or 3) you get your hands on some more cash you're willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down. **DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS** and you will never lose (edit: well, seldom, if ever. Unless the company goes bankrupt, a rare occurrence. This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket, and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero, it won't swallow your portfolio. Also, if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something, you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson). Hedge funds and billionaires know this, that's why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic. They bought the dip while regular folks paper-handed and got even poorer.  One more little trick. If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares, then even if your position goes “underwater,” you can always sell calls at above your average cost, bring DOWN your cost basis, and make money off your stock “risk free” while still following the rule of never sell at a loss. Although if you did it right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze. Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen, and you'll need to be patient and, like I said before, say goodbye to your money for a while.  **EDIT:** Just to reiterate, there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies. Trade however you want, just don’t paper hand GME. I would also note that you *can* sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule, if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price. It still follows the rule of ""don't sell at a loss."" Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100, doesn't matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier. You can even (slowly) take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5%, and sell one when it goes up 5%.  **EDIT:** Yes I know about opportunity cost. It does apply if you know something the general public doesn’t (rare if you’re just a low IQ ape but GME was/is an exception). Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn't, it could be a coin flip whether you'll hit rock bottom. In an ideal world, you can keep some money in reserve so you don’t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities. Yes I know about (and agree with) the sunk cost fallacy. My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal, lowering the cost basis, not “doubling down” on sunk cost.

It’s still a pig but now someone put a little lipstick on it. Dumping it RIGHT into the $RKT squeeze! Worst case I collect the free 5% dividend payout, best case TENDIES ON THE MOON  Not a bot, not financial advice Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
GAM,7,868," the GAME STOPS here wallstreet. WHEN GAMESTOP HITS 10K a share ILL GET A GME FACETAT UNDER MY EYE This was a good explanation for how it works under the “WHY THE GAMESTOP (GME) SHORT SQUEEZE WAS SO MASSIVE,” subhead:   https: millennialmoney.com/gamestop-stock /TIME TO PLAY THE GAME! 8.01  GAME OVER 💎🤲 Apes together GAMESTONK &#x200B;  [This is GME. This is your rocket ship. Its currently fueling up.](https: preview.redd.it/qfw3u6q2qvj61.png?width=3060&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3cd4bcec168e8a068a8de56d40633cb1de77c74)  This is a chart for GME, the price has been adjusted to scale logarithmically to make the trend easier to see and enable us to see all the data points at once. For all you apes out there all that means is the higher you go, the faster you go higher. This trend started in August. It will likely continue as long as Ryan Cohen and the folks he brought over do good work. Now lets address those large spikes.  &#x200B;  [January Ape welcoming party, no despair here.](https: preview.redd.it/x7vxju4trvj61.png?width=3057&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed649938b25bcb7e461ba4ec794d56bbe72fa33)  See this, its a classic example of a textbook speculation bubble (dont panic just breathe and read, if you're having trouble go ask your wifes bf to read it out loud for you.)  [See](https: preview.redd.it/syvpt1m4tvj61.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e65377fc7cfcbd212a6ff8ca714ca330fedf02e)  So a speculation bubble occurred, but why? What caused it and what does that mean going forward? Especially with the recent activity yesterday and today.  Firstly I am not a financial advisor, and I don't give financial advice.  Secondly to answer is pretty simple this was caused by millions of apes rushing to the stock market to buy GME duh. News goes viral about the squeeze the apes buy, paper hands sell. Ok but that sounds really bad right? Again not necessarily. Bubbles like this happen all the time on all just about anything that can be traded over time scales ranging from a few hours to a few months. One of the things that makes GME such unique opportunity is that there is an incredibly tiny number of available shares relative to its market cap. This important for the squeze but it also means the price is more susceptible to dramatic price fluctuations. In fact it is this property that make a squeeze possible, its the nitrous in your gas that turns it into rocket fuel. Imagine you and all your neighbors are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and everyday you get 10 gallons of water to share between you that no big deal but what happens when 10 gallons turns to 9 then 8 then 7 and so on. the less water (available shares) the more volatile you and your neighbors get until eventually everything goes MAD MAX and you have all the water to yourself.  so the speculation boils down to....is this the Squeeze? did it squouze? am i too late? So what does that mean for the apes that boarded at 200 250 400. Well nothing the Price is going to jump around a lot and every time it should settle a little bit higher than before, all the while costing the shorts more and more interest, until the squeeze goes off or the market value has reached your cost basis and you're wishing you bought more dip so you could have averaged down and made a profit by now.  Additionally if you assume the price jump was in fact speculative bubble it means the shorts couldn't really have covered without guaranteeing rocket launch. those arrogant entitled assholes would have had to look in the mirror admit they lost and launch the rocket themselves. OR they could lie to you, and double down. Historically they double down because its not their personal money and the hate being wrong almost as much as they hate losing money  Personally I don't think the shorts will ever capitulate on their own. I think that it will end in one of 3 ways.  1 SEC will turn up some smoking gun of some kind in an investigation that cant be swept away, and a scapegoat will be offered to the public  2 their clearing house will call their the short positions in and they'll go belly up  3 the shorts are right and we're either too dumb or too distracted to out last them  Just to be clear these are all short term endings. The long term end is basically Cohen and Friends save GAMESTOP and turn it into a digital platform powerhouse, or they don't. They got a pretty good track record though. I mean Chewy sells pet food and toys and its valued at nearly 6 times what GAMESTOP is, don't get me wrong I love my dogs but I spend way more on video games each year than I do on pet food and supplies, and I don't think I'm the only one.  OK, so that covers Jan but what about today and yesterday. Well yeah short answer is I'm not sure, but my best guess is that as a result of some options trading practices someone had to buy a bunch of shares to hedge those options and because the available supply is being restricted by all you apes the price reacted extra sensitively kicking off even more hype. This would be a good sign as it means that the fuel mixture (volatility) is getting super powered and just waiting for the right ignition (catalyst.)  &#x200B;  [Just so you know I where I stand](https: preview.redd.it/bnps5z3z8wj61.png?width=2409&format=png&auto=webp&s=84d2dc21952c6ff352955f0bb9a2c67035185815)  TL;DR I like the stock.

ADV,7,7102," IS THIS FINANCIAL ADVICE?!?!? EZ STONK ADVICE Oh and I don't offer FINANCIAL ADVICE referring to the previous post They aren't running out of anything without buying pressure to fill FTDs. These guys have billions to play with and they are making money buying dips and selling options too. They are slowly covering because of limited supply. Once inflation heats up bond yields will shrink the market and suddenly their money pool will become less plentiful. That's when the squeeze will squozen in my retarded opinion.  Synthetic shares are infinite as long as the price points land perfectly. That's why price should be ignored because it's being manipulated to get tens of millions in calls and shorts. Also notice only losses are being advertised and not gains by the media. Why did they ""bail out"" Melvin? The inflation incoming will prove their short positions right before GME can change longterm. Just buy, hold, until the tendieman cometh. They'll eventually win, but we'll win first.  NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE AND JUST CRAYON INFUSED MUSINGS. yes <3  Edit: NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE also hedging puts 🤫 *NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE* Before I start, I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD, and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized. Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!  **Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.  New York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings  Nasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)  **TLDR;/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didn’t suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies/positions.  **In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.  **TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\*\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\*\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)  **START**  I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, I’ve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.  &#x200B;  [GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https: preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)  If you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are “coincidences” as many have suggested.  **PROCESS**  I calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.  &#x200B;  [Covariance & Correlation Matrices.](https: preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)  [P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https: preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)  The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on “luck” or “chance”. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to “luck”. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.  **So, what does this mean?**  **My opinions.**  To me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.  My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.  **Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**  Anyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.  I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR  **Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much  I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of ""correlation does not imply causation"". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **""strength""** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term ""significant"" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little ""\*"" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims "" helps turn food into cellular energy\*"" while other vitamins make claims with no ""\*"".  In layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.  Also, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.  So with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.  Lastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https: firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.  Other than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!  **Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.  [u\/big\_boolean Graph](https: preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)  For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.  **Edit#3** I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields. If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better. **Pointing out problems/faults is important, but providing actionable solutions even more so!**"

You literally cant buy that, but if you tried you'd spend hundreds of millions of real dollars with no guarantee of sucess. GME just got that ad campaign for free.

Take your loss and put it into a stock that can actually rocket...   You really want to miss out on a year or two of possible gains because you think BB might eventually recover?  EDIT: fuck it, stay broke. Your loss porn is fun to laugh at.   You guys must be salty that you missed out on GME, TWICE  It is so fun arguing with all these BRAND NEW ACCOUNTS, or accounts that have been dormant for years. What a bunch of shills. Be careful people...some true pumpers out here AMC/GMC YOU MUST MOVE TO A CASH ACCOUNT!!! The ACCOUNT must be a cash account. It must say (cash account) AMC/GME STONKS: YOU MUST HAVE A CASH ACCOUNT!! no no no, the ACCOUNT cannot say Margin account, according to the article. It makes no difference what you do in it!

BABA,6,39," I miss the time when we were talking about BABA NIO and AAPL on this sub 😭 BABA gang rise up?! 🦍 Everyone should understand that markets are pulling back because of margin calls not fricken interest rates. I’m buying call options on $RTX $RKT $BB $BA $TSLA $AMZN $BABA $JD $PYPL. Trillions are sitting on sidelines and are about to be put to work. I believe we are about to witness a huge bull run. Don’t even get me started on Home prices hitting higher highs. My hedge are $SPXU and $VXX calls as well. Gl on making the $3 mil back but I’m positive you’ll be back on top before eoy. When I get vaccinated I’ll be back playing baccarat as well. 🍻 BABA ANT DD -China maybe first to go cashless 🥸 For me, I wasn't excited about Ant or AliPay being cashless it was more about how profitable/lucrative it would be with such a large market and growing chinese middle class.  I worry that the pulling the IPO last year, re-educating Jack Ma, and some of the public sabre rattling in December was the CCP's way of saying they want a big cut.  I am still hodling my BABA shares, but have been disappointed that it is kind of stuck going sideways and always at the mercy of the CCP. So BABA puts?"
MOV,6,15236," Thats up for you to decide < I believe it's a similar company & that unless a new pandemic keeps them closed down another season or more, that A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL GO TO SEE NEW MOVIES.  I believe it will be worth 5x in 2 years time, If a short squeeze happens then thats just a bonus for us all!!!  I say buy and hold both if you can... WHAT MOVIE IS THIS Man that’s a fucking CRAZY BALLSY MOVE. Hope you’re wife’s boyfriend will let you move in too if it goes south AMC/GMC YOU MUST MOVE TO A CASH ACCOUNT!!! Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!    Grocery Outlet is a boomer bet with overtones of possible insane growth.                            First, the bedrock boomer shit.

GO has just 375 locations in 6 states.   Their most recent 10k was released in 2019 and stated they have a longterm potential of 4,800 locations nationwide. GO is just getting started.  Their longterm growth is projected as 14.7% as compared to industries 12.4% in 2019.   They plan to expand their number of locations by at least 10% a year. This alone gets my dong hard.  As stated in their 10k, their management is not accustomed to operating a publicly owned business. This sounds bad, but is actually a good thing imo. GO is already an amazing business model. Imagine if an Ackman/R. Cohen type character came in and bought a huge chunk or the company installed a few heavy hitters to help scale the business.In fact,last week they added Maria Fernanda Meija(former VP Kellogg's) and Gail Moody-byrd(AI marketing analytics at noodle.ai)  to the board.           The above would be enough to get me to invest if i were a boomer, but as a WSB mutant, I need a possibility of a tendie volcano. Now for storytime.  HOW GROCERY OUTLET OFFERS DEEP DISCOUNTS If a store overstocks, a truck gets misdirected, packaging changes, production changes, or any such interruption in the ""Chain of freshness"" occurs, GO capitalizes on this while saving the other company from taking losses.        THE CHAIN OF FRESHNESS  You may have heard that up to a third of all food produced by Americans is thrown away. https: www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/491513/  The Chain of Freshness describes how this happens and how food MOVES. 1. Food is grown  2. Food sent to be processed and/or packaged/branded. 3. It goes to warehouse(this  sometimes involves many layers of regional and local warehouses.) 4. It goes to a store 5.You buy it.  Anywhere during this chain, product can get slowed down. It wont be fresh enough to  be accepted at the next checkpoint in the Chain, so it goes into a dumpster. Although the ""actual freshness"" of the product may be fresher than you would ever see at a store, its not fresh enough to  go to regional, then local distributors before landing at the store not only fresh enough to consume, but fresh enough to be able to sit on the shelf for however long is required by the stores business plan.   This would be a good time to state that im technically an ""industry insider"" as ive been dumpster diving for years. Ive seen warehouse dumpsters full to the top with product all packaged and nice, fresher than you would ever see at a store. You may have heard in the news recently about portland police guarding dumpsters full of food from citizens. Fred Meyer said the food was spoiled, but it was just unsellable due to liability issues and food quality laws. Perfectly edible food. https: apnews.com/article/portland-storms-oregon-4eebd2cd2f1b9f798667994bc871a647  This is just the tip of the iceberg, as warehouse dumpsters are usually behind fences and guarded with cameras so no one sees that waste, except for me. I fill my backpack with organic chocolate, hipflasks of brandy, and have personally recovered enough frozen marinated ribs to grill up and play Meat Jenga with(which we actually did.)  This waste is caused by logistics problems which could be alleviated by Grocery Outlet, adding value to everyone involved                   Now imagine this company if Food Waste Laws are passed, penalizing companies who waste food. With images of cops chasing people away from a dumpster full of perfectly good food in the news, the discussion is very likely to surface among other progressive talking points. Grocery Outlet is uniquely positioned to profit from this trend. If Companies were all of a sudden compelled to reduce their waste, it would be a huge growth opportunity. Just based on their current guidance GO is a great bet. But in this rapidly changing world, a newly public company like GO with an innovative business model can change its current guidance multiple times.  Tldr; a long standing glitch in the logistics of how we sell and move food around leads to dumpsters full of perfectly good food that makes up about a third of all the food Americans produce. GO has a unique business plan that, with the help of a big-dick activist investor,  hiring of corporate heavy hitters, and the Possibility of Food Waste Laws could turn those dumpsters full of food into dumpsters full of money for everyone involved.  Heres a link to an article that has the numbers I referenced. https: finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-grocery-outlet-144102370.html  Positions: All shares, about 10% of my investment capital. Long hold. I literally love the stock. I identify with grocery outlet on an emotional level. They allow me to buy all the fancy snacks I like and my loyalty to them is the closest ive come to  truly experiencing religion in my life."
IVE,6,2669," Melvin: *talking about how the already covered*  WSB: *on fire* FOR GOD SAKES JUST GIVE ME THE DAMN SQUEEZE Schwab had a bug on their platform that caused double selling and double buying in client cash accounts. Yes, it is a fucked up disaster. And yes, I'm already talking to lawyers so please none of the ""lawyer up"" shit, I know what I'm doing.  I'm just here to tell you the story.  This bug caused my 401(k) cash account to be out $180k. See my Sunday post last week if you want details: [https: www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a\_bug\_in\_schwab\_caused\_my\_retirement\_account\_to/](https: www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/)  Forget about my account though. Look at the comments. This was me posting randomly on /r/stocks and without prompting for it, I got over 60 comments that said the same thing happened to them.  Let's figure this out with some (admittedly imprecise) napkin math:  * Suppose Schwab is \~5% of total stock market volume. * U.S. Trading volume is maybe $1.250T (between Nasdaq + NYSE) * Suppose the bug affects 5% of trades on Schwab. (This number has to be big enough account for the fact that so many comments appeared on my post) * Suppose each illegal trade on average moves 10% before it gets resolved. * Schwab is on the hook for any of these price movements that result in losses (half the price movements, because half were gains and some customers probably made out like bandits?) * 1250000000000 \* 0.05 \* 0.05 \* 0.1 \* 0.5  **= $156m per day?** in what I'm referring to as ""a giant ball of shit""  Important points:  1. Schwab could be losing something on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per day. Is the bug fixed? I have not seen any announcements about it. It's been over 30 days and I still haven't gotten a clear response from Schwab about my own personal issue. 2. This has been a problem for months, according to the comments. Read through the comments on my post in /r/stocks. 3. Schwab only has about $20B in total equity (according to Wikipedia, 2018) 4. I could have easily left GME naked short in my account. I don't know what Schwab would have done, or how many accounts have gone naked short, and stayed that way...  It still does not appear that the markets have priced this event in, yet. At best, Schwab lost some money. At worst, Schwab is actually bankrupt. I (currently) don't think it's very likely that they're bankrupt, but I do believe the markets are mispricing their stock.  **Schwab: If you don't want us speculating about how big this ball of shit is, then come out and say exactly how big it is. And tell us where the ""fix it"" money is coming from. Not client assets, I hope?**  Stay tuned for some more traditional DD in the coming days/weeks.

We were supposed to put our FIGURATIVE d!cs in? Shit, I’ve been doing this wrong all along : /Did anyone see the footage LIVE yesterday? There is a part of Uncle Bruce’s show mentioning “a secret “, that is now edited out of his broadcast. He basically said that the loss will be in the Trillions to HF and the stock will rocket to the moon. Anyone holding stock paid with cash would be crazy to sell it. Somehow this 2 minute rant is now missing out of the broadcast. He got up and walked behind his desk, which was at 2:46 sec into the broadcast on Friday. Hum, 🤔 Not a single doubt that had trading not been stopped in January it would’ve been 700+ by open Friday morning. It WOULD have cleared 1k. I don’t think 10k was feasible, 5k maybe.  Agreed there is a MASSIVE sweet spot at the 500 range due to gamma, I’m really not sure if at this point it’ll clear $1,500. GME is (like another post mentioned) is a meme, it’s running its own course and impossible to predict. BOUGHT MORE! LET'S DRIVE AMC AND GME TO THE FREAKING SKY!!!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀"

EDIT: fuck it, stay broke. Your loss porn is fun to laugh at.

FSR,5,3," Sell it and move on to better plays. FSR! Those hedgies are tough to beat because they act as one with large amounts of $. This community proved they could be beat but hit em again with the same punch in the same place? I don't know about that. To convince the bag holders not to sell off if their buy in price is ever reached again would be tough. Move the money to a new ticker in an industry that is growing rather than shrinking. FSR could be the next Tesla! This  is why  buy stock   Out right I’m on Robin Hood I’m looking at like right now I’m looking at FSR. Brought 300.     N I wait.   Over a week ago was going to go up and up and up and I will not show it I will just take a profit off of it you never sell the stock you just take the profit allowed to keep building  And when I say take a profit you wanna go way down to put maybe like all the way to $10 never go farther because you’re stuck at that price and if it goes down you  got the  money I think GME was a one off. The stars aligned if you look at the low float (69 million) and over 100% short. However, FSR could be similar to a few others that received attention in the wallstreetbets community. It seems most similar to Tilray. Tilray had sector momentum then a price target upgrade. It had modest backing from conventional analysts. Fundamentally it is more sound than the other stocks with big runs in this community. It reached double it's highest price target before falling back to 🌎. I think Fisker could get to $80 near term. Even if it falls after reaching $80, I think it will be back. FSR is a sleeping giant."
WKHS,5,15," What were @CathieDWood’s biggest weekly moves?

When you sell, you own nothing, you have no claim from that point on. When you hold, you at least still own something and you have a claim, what potential that yields is hard to say at times but it's more than nothing. Think of a store that has inventory sitting on the shelf for what is determined to suddenly be too long. Do they just toss it into the dumpster and take a total loss? They shouldn't, someone would pay something for it. So selling at a loss is certainly better than a total loss, but in the world of stonks how would they go into the dumpster? If they do, the least of your worries should be about losing all your money but instead how did you convince yourself to buy in the first place. But what factor does this point have which changes things? Time. This is why suddenly a store decides, shelf space could be better used, space (volume) and time. They think a different product on the shelf will perform better with the shelf space over the same or less amount of time. But what if they could simply take a loss on a little of the shitty product and use the remaining shelf space towards a little of the new product? Space and time equilibrium. You don't have to dump everything if you only need a little space with the same amount of time to make up. Time is everything because you're dying and only have so much left but volume is important too.     From a hypothetical point, I would expect something like GME to spike about every month. Why? People get paid, monthly debts are settled. Now, I can't say for sure that GME will trend like most stocks where the highs just diminish over time, but people are losing on it, no doubt about that, each and every time that happens it removes potential capital which could go into that stock in the next buy frenzy. Then there's the subjective aspect, people don't like the unpredictable when it starts to really hurt, so they avoid, at the same time people inherently understand, nothing lasts forever, so they avoid. Either way, the spikes get smaller and smaller each month.     The last spike only produced about 280% compared to the \~2100% in Jan. I can capture that in 56 days of regular trading with a lot less risk. True I might be able to shave off a lot of time IF I max out the margin on GME and IF I was right about it and with much less equity. OR, I could just continue at 5% daily gains which I get. Something I see people not considering is a fixed amount they need by the end of the \~250 trading days, a real amount. I know what I want to make and only make in that year. Getting to the moon is not priority, priority is a real number I'm going to put on my returns every year. Everything changes once that is factored in. The way I look at charts, I'm not just interested in how deep or how high, I'm really interested in what is the absolute longest time in a dip, what is the average time in a gain. And if I can't determine that because there is so much noise, it's excluded. There's volatility which I like, I actually need to meet that daily average and then there's just pure chaos. That determines what I do with that stock. So far, since the early 90's, I've been doing well, very well considering and I started as simply selecting with what was essentially someone else's money because I was too young. I've known success, $100K (which started as $10K) in Apple in 2006 because someone bought me an iPod for my birthday, something I knew absolutely nothing about and it encouraged me to research. But I really like pattern trading. So in college I started.     With GME I would do this, wait until the third week of the month, buy with a limit that I think would give me a 20% gain and that's it, then back to sanity, if the limit fails to execute, I didn't want it anyways so don't care. Yeah, it really only would give me 4 days of trading that I can completely fuck up on, but that's 4 days, I'll take it. Don't get greedy, that's what fucks people, they get greedy and the best way to let greed destroy your returns is not determining what you need to earn before you buy as opposed to what you want to earn. Well fuck, I want ACMR to trade at Tesla prices, ok, that's not going to happen by then end of the year. There's absolutely nothing out there to suggest this (unless someone out here knows something I don't) LOL     Know how much you need at the end of a day, a month, a quarter and a year and use that to determine whether you stay in or out after you've already determined that the stock is reliable which is why you shouldn't have to worry about selling. IF at the end of a years trading you have more than expected, then you can dump it on shit like GME, it's bonus money if you want to see it that way because it was unexpected, but when you come up short the next year suddenly that money won't be looked at as a bonus anymore. If you are never able to view additional earnings as a bonus (which you won't be able to if you didn't establish a necessary end amount to begin with), stay away from things that are unpredictable, that the universe says, this would be a complete anomaly and is unnatural and you will never have to sell at a loss because it will never stay as a permanent loss.     That being said....I have about $85K tied up into complete bullshit stocks right now....just waiting and no, I will never, ever sell until they at least start to break even several times and I've found something which will produce as well or better. I'm stubborn that way but that's the bonus money I really don't give a shit about. My seed has been out for about a month because I saw this coming. Some would say, no, this is the time to buy everything, no it's not because I haven't seen even a -4 on the Great Oscillator which is to be obeyed, period. We're getting there though. So instead of putting yourself in a position of not selling, try putting yourself in a position of not buying in the first place. Stop caring about missing opportunities that are only regretful with hindsight and start realizing dips are forever, they're infinite and you only need a few every now and then. Different ways of looking at things. I would rather miss a golden opportunity than to be denied the ability to trade when I want even if that meant I have puny returns in comparison. Reliability first and foremost, then Hail Mary's and if you can never part with your earnings, that's ok too.     As for sticking it to the man, I remember watching the floor getting cleaned up on Wednesdays on the boob tube and the movies sucked me in when I was a kid. Hedges et al will always be around, they will survive, it's all they do, I don't care if they get wealthier, I care about me getting wealthier cause I know way, way too many people rely on those guys....they're fucking impervious. But I sort of want them that way, I need more money in the market, last thing I want to do is reduce it, that would be like hoping everyone gets fucked so I can pick up stocks at the lowest prices in history because nobody has any money to buy them so they're worthless. Why the fuck would I want that? I say manipulate all you want, retail, hedge, who cares because at the end of the day, if you can't read the fine lines in the bullshit, you shouldn't be trading. That being said, let's all watch WKHS either destroy Wood or turn her into an oracle, like there hasn't been hundreds of those before right? Like they lose one contract and suddenly they might as well have never produced anything to this point!? So stupid. Never sell at a loss, k, never buy at a loss, never sell at a gain, never buy at a gain or DD and you don't have to worry about nevers. Big difference between a ""loss"" perceived and a loss achieved; sense of time, patience and calm and knowing where you wanted to be in the first place and did you have a plan and how much error is acceptable in the plan. That's as good as it gets. Now get out there you retards and start buying the shit out of ACMR...kidding, don't I need the price to be logical. LMAO $PRPL gang! I’m hoping for a nice lift off. News should be great.  $WKHS Luckily I bought at $10.11. I should have sold at $40, but that’s the way the cards fell. Hoping for some great news this week. Hey, if NKLA could pull something out of their ass to beat the earnings estimate and then spew some nonsense that makes it sound like they have an actual path forward towards increased profitability, WKHS can too.   Of course no one believed NKLA’s bullshit..."
WOR,5,174," They're called options.   There are basically two types of options, call options and put options.    Someone who has 100 shares on a stock can write 1 option. They are essentially betting their 100 shares that the price will go down, in which case they write a call option, or go up so they write a put option. They do this because they want to receive the premium payment, which is the cost to buy the contract off them, and the interest of holding the option, but not have the contract exercised and for it to expire worthless.    Options have a strike price, an end date, and a premium.    The strike price is the price at which the options writer is willing to sell their share prices at x 100 no matter what the current stock price is. Have a strike price of $2 but current stock price is $900? Well it doesn't matter because your option says you must sell the underlying shares at $2. The premium is the cost to buy the contract that gives the purchaser the choice to exercise that contract before the end date and buy or sell those underlying shares at the strike price. The premium takes into account things like difference between the current stock price and the strike price, called intrinsic value, takes into account time for the option to move in the money, and volatility, how swingy the stock is (which means it could be in the money or out of the money on the same day, which makes it more likely to net a profit) and that's called implied volatility.    Finally the options have an end date which is the date the buyer of the option has to exercise the option and get those 100 shares.    So the writer places their bet and along comes a WSB retard who says ""I see your call option and I'll take that bet"" because unlike the writer they think the stock price will rise and become ITM before the expiry date. So they purchase the option paying the premium x 100 (because there are 100 shares) and they hold but don't exercise the option. The writer gets the premium and the WSB retard gets the call option and waits.    Important to remember but 99% of options are not exercised but rather the option itself is traded between traders because the premium is often worth more than exercising the stock, paying the strike price, and then selling that stock at the current share price.    So if the contract becomes ITM the option becomes more valuable especially if it has more time on it because the chance of the stock moving in the direction required becomes more likely. If its netting huge profit the WSB retard sells that option to someone else (or holds) and nets the profit of the premium.   If the option gets to its agreed end date and expires WORTHLESS (or Out of the money) then the WSB retard has only lost his initial investment of the premium x 100 and the options writer (who wanted it to expire worthless) keeps his underlying stock to sell more options.    Note that options can be written without owning the underlying stock and these are called naked options, and its dangerous and stupid as fuck to do. Otherwise they're known as covered options because if for some reason the WSB retard wants to exercise the option then the writer can cover it and give them the 100 shares.    Call option buyers think the price will go up.    Put option buyers think the price will go down.     Call option writers think the price will go down.   Put option writers think the price will go up.    Put options are a little more complicated but the basic understanding is that the person who owns the put option has the right to sell 100 shares at the strike price.    That's the basics. Well, somewhat related, WORD-WORD-3487 users aren't necessarily bots, I see a lot of people accusing them of being bots, but they're just phone normies who used the new reddit mobile onboarding process that chooses a username for you if you're lazy.  I see a lot of people accusing others of being bots or of foul play on relatively flimsy grounds like that. IS ANYONE WORRIED  THAT WHEN THE HEDGE FUNDS START SELLING THEIR OTHER ASSETS TO COVER THEIR LOSSES  IT COULD CREATE A DOWNWARD SPIRAL IN THE MARKET AND CRASH If you buy the few thousand dollars now instead of waiting until it, potentially never, goes back down to 45, then it will help move the price up sooner  Or do you think GME IS NOT WORTH 100!?

XOM,5,1354," Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰  Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:  When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.  RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself).   $RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back.   It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT.   BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?  GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you.   The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.  Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November.   Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.  BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:  Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?    TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌   Edit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40.

Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc.

A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!

Positions: GME 65 shares @ $105.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/eddie-gilbert-the-boy-wonder-of-wall-street#:~:text=On%20June%2012%2C%201958%2C%20the,remaining%2050%25%20of%20Bruce%20stock.  Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.  The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis  Saunders vs. the Shorts Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.   The Shorts Are Cornered Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.   Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.   https: www.americanheritage.com/jacob-schiff-and-northern-pacific-corner#2  In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.  Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.  On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.  Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.  By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.  Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.  The New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.  https: www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26 https: www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.  Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.  At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.  VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.  The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.  In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.  “The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.  “In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”  Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.  Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.  “We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”  Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.  It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”  Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.  The “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.  Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.  “Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.  Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.  Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.  VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING? Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.  This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.  Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.  “The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.  Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.  But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.  When asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”  The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.  https: www.marketwatch.com/story/squeeze-on-goldman-put-falcone-in-penalty-box-2013-08-21  Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.  He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.  In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.  Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.  It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.  As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.  In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.  Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.  Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)  This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.  That’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.  Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.  The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.  “Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.  I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.  “Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.  https: moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/  [Removed to keep within character limit]  https: nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/  After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.  The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.  But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.  Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.  The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.  Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.  “There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.  Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.  Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”  Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.  Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.  “Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.  Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.  But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.  “We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.  Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.  Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.  Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.  Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.  https: medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d  The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.  At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.  With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.  Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.  Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda: “Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.” This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.  Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.  Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.  Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned. Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.  Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.  From The Great Game:  “Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”  Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”  Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”  Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.  “The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‘short of Harlem’, meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’”"

Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.

Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates Thanks again for the very generous sharing!   May I ask: why the conviction on BIDU? Especially with the rotation out of the tech sector. I think The stock split, HK listing, and eventual EV is a lethal combo but you’re right, that’s only IF we can breathe some life into tech this week  With JNJ announcement that’s tenuous, though, but I’ll probably be betting on BIDU all the way down Lolol"

TRIL,5,95," How can you honestly believe 100K or even 50K is possible?  If it got anywhere close to that level you are talking market cap of TRILLIONS of dollars, higher than the GDP of the USA, about on par with the total value of the entire market.  Even if it somehow magically inflated to this level, do you really think any of us would actually see any of it, they are going to somehow be able to just start handing BILLIONS of dollars to the average investor? I’m all in as well but seeing the disconnect from reality in some of these posts is just mind blowing to me. Bro it’s not a theory😂 there only exists about $2 trillion in all of the world so how in the fuck would they pay out $600 TRILLION. How can you really believe 10k to 130k? There are something like 69 Million shares outstanding. If prices somehow rose to anywhere close to that level, you are talking TRILLONS of dollars. Where do you think this money would come from, do you really think anyone would see any of it if it came down to this? CME is insured for around 40 TRILLION... they're currently sitting on about 85 million shorts of a stock that only has 70 million in existence. Oops! That's a big fucking oops! The fed pumped TRILLIONS into the market last year along with all time low interest rates and bad bond rates.  This year will be the true test for her funds. Go through and see how many of her picks were penny stocks last year, before she pumped 100m into each to bring them into the teens.  I think she'd be better off doing a fire sale on all of her overpriced crap and start pumping new penny stocks."

That GME isn’t something that will take us into retirement or success in the long run. I say FUCK EM! I say it’s time us the “little people” show the “big people” that we can control our own futures, that we indeed know what we’re doing and that we indeed believe in our cause and that we are not going to give in and give them what we want, we don’t care how much money they have or how much power they have, UNITED WE WILL SUCCEED, UNITED WE WILL COME OUT ON TOP, UNITED WE WILL MAKE HISTORY!

IQ,5,5767," Now THIS is good financial advice. The cat’s IQ is clearly higher than any of ours, will buy more 🚀 You must have an IQ of 160! It sounds sophisticated enough that I might believe my IQ goes up by 1 for each share I own. 💎🙌🦍here. I wrote some basic advice I'll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action, or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper-handing. Paper-handing is fundamentally bad investment practice, especially if you're a new investor. I'll explain why.  *DISLAIMER: I've only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff, and he hasn’t steered me wrong yet. So take it for what it’s worth... But based on all the fact that paper-handing is even an issue here, you apes clearly need this advice.* ***EDIT: These are ""fundamentals"" to the way I trade, but obviously everyone's trading strategy is different. Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing, which doesn't encourage YOLO-ing. This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to ""outsmart"" the general public by spotting opportunities/value before the market does. I feel it's particularly relevant to the GME play. The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it. There are other approaches (which often require more experience) but I feel this is most accessible to new investors. GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything. Well, everything that you don’t think will go bankrupt or get delisted.***  **New traders, or people who are thinking of becoming new traders, should read this.** Especially if you're new, I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market. This applies to all stock, not just GME. If you're experienced, it might just sound like I'm explaining at length why 2 + 2 = 4, but since a friend of a friend told me he paper-handed on GME (sold the dip), I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea.  **I would encourage people to buy GME, but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while.** (edit: in addition, just to reiterate, keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down) By this I mean **NEVER SELL AT A LOSS**. Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down. All newbie investors (IMO) should adhere to this rule just in general. Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground, or don’t buy it at all.  Many investors, myself included, follow this rule religiously, not just with GME but with all stocks. I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss, I just held or bought more. COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out? I just held and was fine... should have bought more. If everyone bought into GME with this mindset, I bet it would go to Pluto easily.  If you sell at a loss, you are donating to the ""save the short sellers"" fund out of your own wallet, fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes, and you’re not even following sound investment practice. Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy. If you’re thinking of investing so much that you’ll wuss out, poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red... just don’t. Emotion and the stock market do not mix well.  Stop losses (below purchase price) are also for pansies and genuine idiots. “I’ll sell you some stock... but only if you give me a bad enough price on it.” Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down... if you feel like you need a stop loss, you're investing more than you should. Instead of being stupid, maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips.  Side note: personally, in the case of GME, I don’t have any limit sells either. From what I can tell on past short squeezes, the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down. So as long as you keep an eye on GME when it actually does skyrocket, you should have plenty of time. Set price alerts and relax. No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid-launch.  Although, if you want you can try to profit off GME volatility. Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I'm not sure they deserve it. As far as I know, buying low and selling high doesn’t really help HFs, it drives the price up (just not as much as buying and holding). But personally, my philosophy is, I can take baby profits anytime... who knows when something like this GME rise will happen again. So I’m holding (101 shares at cost average $106/share).  Want to get into the game now? You could always just buy a few shares, and keep the rest of what you’re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip. And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more, bringing your cost average down. Ideally, you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero. Always try to keep cash in reserve.  Locked yourself in at a high price? That's why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down. Didn't keep any cash in reserve? Guess you're stuck waiting for one of three things: 1) the short squeeze which will likely (though not certainly) happen, 2) for the price of GME to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases, or 3) you get your hands on some more cash you're willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down. **DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS** and you will never lose (edit: well, seldom, if ever. Unless the company goes bankrupt, a rare occurrence. This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket, and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero, it won't swallow your portfolio. Also, if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something, you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson). Hedge funds and billionaires know this, that's why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic. They bought the dip while regular folks paper-handed and got even poorer.  One more little trick. If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares, then even if your position goes “underwater,” you can always sell calls at above your average cost, bring DOWN your cost basis, and make money off your stock “risk free” while still following the rule of never sell at a loss. Although if you did it right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze. Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen, and you'll need to be patient and, like I said before, say goodbye to your money for a while.  **EDIT:** Just to reiterate, there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies. Trade however you want, just don’t paper hand GME. I would also note that you *can* sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule, if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price. It still follows the rule of ""don't sell at a loss."" Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100, doesn't matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier. You can even (slowly) take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5%, and sell one when it goes up 5%.  **EDIT:** Yes I know about opportunity cost. It does apply if you know something the general public doesn’t (rare if you’re just a low IQ ape but GME was/is an exception). Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn't, it could be a coin flip whether you'll hit rock bottom. In an ideal world, you can keep some money in reserve so you don’t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities. Yes I know about (and agree with) the sunk cost fallacy. My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal, lowering the cost basis, not “doubling down” on sunk cost.  Tl;dr 🦍buy 🍌, don’t give 🐍 🍌 unless 🐍 give more than 🦍pay for 🍌  Not financial advice. I am literally a zoo ape that somebody dropped their phone into the enclosure of. GME is a special case of “opportunity cost.” Most of the time, low IQ apes like us wouldn’t know an opportunity from a pile of gorilla shit... let alone identify one before the general public does. But GME is something the general public is slow to come around to, because the media is trying to sweep it under the rug. So, welcome aboard the apemobile.  I wouldn’t put all my eggs in one basket, and I’d keep money in reserve in case you need to buy, but you do you."
SPOK,5,7, THE CAT HAS SPOKEN!! LET THE SIEGE BEGIN he has SPOKEN THE CAT HATH SPOKEN!! #BUY BUY BUY THE KITTY HAS SPOKEN! THE CAT HAS SPOKEN
KF,5,685," Hmmm maybe this explains why Cathie Wood sold a bunch of Schwab from ARKF on Thursday... Schwab is in Cathie's ARKF fund, OP's argument is invalid I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.  By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.  Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/  First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!!   Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink.   Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here.   By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.  Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.  When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.  UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!  Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.  Space Ape out  TLDR:   * $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU * $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI * $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot * $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds * $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon  EDIT: Fresh data in.... Added Wendys and the 100k moon prediction The big spikes are my GME shares and one April 200c  Edit: other positions, bunch of ARKF calls that went to shit, 100 PLTR shares at 25 avg. calls on XOM and BP for July. couple other things in the red Yeah the core investments should be ok. I got a 01/23 ARKF 60c, but unfortunately right before the dip"
APH,5,17," Buying more APHA and TLRY. Weed stocks going to FLY this month 🚀🚀🌙 So APHA or TLRY? Thank god APHA and TLRY aren’t on there....now maybe we can make some money I still like the GME stock but it seems to be an orchestrated dead cat bounce to get retail to FOMO in. Take a look at WSB and it clearly worked. It'll probably happen 2-3 more times in the future because people will bet the farm that GME goes up another 100-800% (and they would probably diamond hand for more because infinity gazillion is not a meme). Meanwhile, RKT is straight up free tendies with no downside risk. My prediction is that when RKT lands on the moon, the 7,000,000 new WSB members will FOMO in at the last minute (see Tilray, APHA, GME, AMC, NOK, BB, PLTR, etc...), and be stuck with the bag again. Then they will hate on whatever the next best play is before FOMOing into the top again. This only makes sense if the gap remains consistent at the moment when shares are converted. Over the past couple of weeks, the gap between APHA and TLRY has been decreasing. Another thing to keep in mind is that when the conversion occurs, new shares will be introduced to TLRY, thus lowering the overall price of the stock. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD."
EPS,5,690," Some ape just tried telling me AMC has great fundamentals. They’ve had a negative EPS for the last year. Some of these apes are going to get absolutely fucked. Sigh, and if that was how stocks worked, they would instantly jump by the declared EPS every quarter like clockwork   All that efficient market hypothesis is complete bullshit. I used ER instead of EPS (Earnings per share). The average multiple for the financial sector as of 02/26 was 12.17. RKT's EPS for 2020 was 4.08 × 12.17 = $49.65 = Undervalued vs Financial Sector(which includes more than just bank) by about 56%. This stock would need to more than double (and would without heavy short interest) to be fairly valued. The SI holding it down has kept retail away due to the early burn and FOMO. After whopping SPY's ass for decades, BRK has lagged it the last two years by over 20%, counting SPY dividends ([1](https: finance.yahoo.com/chart/BRK-B#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)). That's about to change drastically. This morning, Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42.3%, said they repurchased $24.7 billion in shares in 2020, and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year ([2](https: www.berkshirehathaway.com/2020ar/linksannual20.html)). In addition, Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter. However, more important than any of these things (as significant as they are) is what was missing from the letter this year.  As many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years. He's complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term. In the meantime, he's fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines, banks, japanese conglomerates, etc. With this backdrop, remember that Buffett is not a boomer, he's from the Silent Generation. So, what he didn't say in the report is really important.   So what the fuck didn't he say? He didn't complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn't warn that BRK might lag SPY. You're not grasping the significance yet. Let me explain.  The reason he's been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants. In fact, he explains in his letter linked above that they're even better. He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them. Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner.  Over the next year, the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter. There's no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine.  Also, here's some simple math for you. SP500 P/E ratio: 38.8. BRK P/E ratio: 13.5. [Yes, I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK's P/E. That's because BRK's portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income.] This means BRK's underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion!  This is why Buffett didn't warn that BRK might underperform. He's back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY's ass again. Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK's multiple again.  Calls were cheap on Friday so I bought 170 BRK.B $242.50C 3/5/21. $50K YOLO on the Oracle of Omaha. **TL;DR RKT is going to bull run all the way to the 9th March after its beautiful earnings and it's time to burn some shorts.**  Yesterday pre-earnings I posted some [DD](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsdpuz/rkt_to_the_moon_dd_and_short_squeeze_opportunity/) on why RKT (Rocket Companies) was a buy. I was right, the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10% from highs of a 20% gain during the day. To someone that has not followed RKT this may seem like a missed opportunity. WRONG. Welcome to the Amazon of the Finance World (well near enough).  Rocket by all traditional measures should've risen to $25 (previous close of $19.90) minimum today. Their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past. Practically since the IPO institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls, some covered, some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between $19 and $21 or to average down from a bag holding position above. These players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase (a potential gamma squeeze if it did so). Hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below $22.  **Next week, things start to change...**  But before that let's just go over the insane earnings they just report:  1. **EPS $1.09** (analyst prediction $0.87) an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from $754 million to $2.84 billion. 2. A **special dividend of $1.11** per share to Class A common stock holders on March 9th (note this is important autists). 3. **Partnerships with a multitude of companies including JP Morgan**. 4. Stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended. 5. There's more little nuggets but that's enough for ape brain to take in.  **So what happens next week?**  Firstly the dividend at current stock price is just over **5% yield**. An insane amount. This provides a catalyst for the price in two ways. Firstly, who doesn't want any easy 5% return? This is hardly priced in let's be realistic. These earnings give RKT as **PE of 5**. Way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around **3 to 4 times too small** if you consider them a Fintech.  More importantly, let's have a look at RKT's **short interest**. It lies somewhere between 35% and 40%. Now let's be clear this isn't going to be a Reddit, retail investor driven **short squeeze**, RKT has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million BUT if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure. Shorts have to pay the dividend - an instant 5% loss is not a good look and who knows if there'll be more to come in later earnings. With call holders less in the equation, the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies. It's time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the IPO.  Everyone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover, and 40% of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me. A huge difference between RKT and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above $30 indefinitely (or higher). Shorts don't like to be stuck indefinitely losing, unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse - not that they will unless you all have weak hands. Expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around $30+ to drive the price up more.  With all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of March. I have a genuine PT after that earnings of $40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ship's favour the moon is only the beginning. This Rocket is going up Uranus like your wife's boyfriend's is up hers.  Rocket is recruiting diamond hands, I am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10% profit BUT autists and apes we can get 100%, 200% or more!  RKT closed at $21.85 today. It is my firm believe RKT is a **brilliant buy** after these earnings under $24 and if the bull run starts all the way to $30. Management want these shorts out and that's good enough for me, the CEO laughed at the shorts on CNBC.  I am willing to put my money where my mouth is as I averaged up from $30 per cent equivalent CfD contracts at $20.30 to $41 per cent equivalent at $20.91.  In other words get us to $46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade. These values are actually GBP but I presumed you only know dollar due to autism.  **I just like the stock. So buy shares, squeeze shorts.**  **RKT TO THE MOON!**  [Earnings Call Transcript](https: www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/)  EDIT: VERY IMPORTANT POINT - some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95% is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion not far off GME. Just more reason to buy  Disclaimer: This is not financial advise and should not be taken as such.

But what they don't understand, is you can't get to Valhalla in a pink electric car playing it safe. So the way I say it, you autists must be doing something right. "" Brilliant Minds always encounter the most violent opposition."" Einstein. They used to say he was crazy, always shooting for the moon too.  I don't get it. Looks like the only thing he was down on were the DDD calls. Wouldn't Fidelity just sell the position to cover themselves? Or they forced him to exercise his positions and buy the shares for 3 million... so not really a loss No silly we DO DD on stocks we don’t BUY DDD stock. Easy misconception HOLDDDDD TIL 1000+!!!!!!!!"
UAL,5,603," Look at the posts from WSB a couple years ago. It's the absolute degenerative bets that laid the foundation of this sub. This is a nice nostalgic throwback to the ACTUAL YOLOS people would make. Not some loser that holds 10 share in a memestock. This is a place for BETS Waiiiit I had the same issue months ago. I tried to sell my UAL stock after a huge spike, and it kept saying there were server issues. Then I check an hour later, and it double sold me so I was short UAL! Now, it ended up making me money in the end so I didn't care, but I've been careful since. That's wild it happened to you too LETS PROVE OUR BOOMER PARENTS WRONG! AND SHOW EM WE CAN MAKE THEIR 10 YEAR MUTUAL FUND PORTFOLIO IN 2 DAYS! THIS IS AN APE MARKET NOW! 🦍🦍🦍 DO NOT BE UPSET! THIS IS ACTUAL FUCKING PROOF YOU ALL DID THAT KEEP GOING AND REMEMBER WE CAN BOYCOTT WE ARE THE PEOPLE [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates"

As expected of a 1mon old account, this is complete bs. Sorry to pop your bubble, but it is EXTREMELY UNLIKELY that Melvin will run out of cash to leverage their shorts. You've seen yourself the manipulation; if they hedged every high and low they would never run out of capital, not to mention their sold calls that expired OTM. The squeeze will also never reach a point so as to bankrupt Melvin, because the SEC will step in to prevent a massive degrossings. Plus, Melvin rolled up their shorts to the hundreds, maybe even 400, so if you use the same ratio as before, GME would need to reach >5000$ to make them bankrupt. If it even gets close to that, we'll see the same closings of brokerages, media attacks, etc all enacted by the SEC. If this was before the move up then they have entered a back spread and it would imply the hedge funds are EXTREMELY bullish on the stock. In other words, literally everyone in the world including Melvin and Citadel thinks GME will go to the moon and the price action in the past month is a bunch of none sense.  Hope you realise how ridiculous it sounds.   More likely case is that youtube dude didn’t know that “hedge funds” don’t actually hedge their bets. Check out the physical deliveries from the comex last month. 45 Million ounces. This is real, it's not a ploy. It's the one money government does not know you have.  Also PM producers like AG and AEM are EXTREMELY  leveraged. PM prices go up 10% they are up 30-40%."
TSM,5,11,"  ""Chip shortage is to be solved once AMD releases and showcases their new Radeon RX 6000 GPU (Radeon RX 6700 Series) March 3 this is to give an alternative option NVDA’s unit GeForce RTX 3060""  I hope you realize AMD does not actually manufacture semiconductors.  TSM makes them for AMD.  AMD has zero influence on the supply of semiconductors. i do realize this but AMD does has influence as they are providing a product that requires semiconductors and the product is in high demand thus meaning that AMD will make money. TSM is already inflated a shit ton. TSM doesn’t just supply car manufactures... TSM supplies computers and sorry to say but more people are buying computers than new cars. Also TSM is now prioritizing auto manufacturers chips over the general pc wafers. I think AMD NVDA UMC AMBA and the like will be doing well over the next few years. NVDA isn't a foundary.  I'm considering TSM, INTC, and maybe MU."

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want!

There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF.

Obligatory 🚀  WARNING: BY THE END OF THIS POST YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS EUPHORIA OR PREMATURE 🚀 SYNDROME. THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF 'CONFIRMATION BIAS'. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE.  [Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)  \----------  Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https: www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https: www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https: www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.  \----------  For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:  ""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xw8lu1l122k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=644af631e8387d60cb475e33e67fcd1c66018b8d This DD is misleading.  JFrog has a lot of competition and highly likely will get killed by the current way of publishing artifacts through containers and much more valued brands. AWS, Docker, GCP all have container repositories. Gitlab and Github other host artifacts.   They bought a weakass CI/CD solution to try to compete in a tough space with big players dominating the market like Github, Gitlab, CircleCI, they have zero chances of taking a big piece of the pie, they might upsell this feature along with dying artifactory if they're lucky.  The companies mentioned as customers, they might be using JFrog but for some fringe projects and most likely can be replaced in an instant, they will be using their own much better tech for the majority of projects.  Comparison with Atlassian(TEAM) and Crowdstrike(CRWD) is also wrong and misleading, they're both dominant forces in team collaboration and security respectively.  JFrog is a relic of the past addressing needs of the enterprise software, which soon might be if they're not already addressed but companies with much better dev tool suite in general and better following.  The valuation of already 5bln for this company I find laughable but those are the times.  TL;DR ANTI ROCKET SYSTEM  I've been a software engineer >10 years and I've never had a need for JFrog. Currently in dev tool space. It's not a winner. Stay away."
ELS,4,119," All I’m saying is it FEELS like one of the words is written in all caps I feel like everyone is copying and pasting their  SQUEEZE NOVELS every other 20 mins. We got it   IT WILL BE 6000000000 OR ELSE SHORT SQUEEZE THA FAT F I loved how just last week (before the spike of course), we had some members of the WSB community making fun of $GME ""bagholders"" and telling us to ""let it go already"".  Well....IF YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE FOLKS FUCK YOU BECAUSE $GME & $AMC HODLERS ARE ON A ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON AND YOU'RE NOT INVITED SO GO SHILL SOMEWHERE ELSE."
XT,4,76," Buy MarsCoin on XT guys. 100$-150$ soon. Your mention of loaning crazy DTI ratios in 2008 paralells the nearly 10 fold increase we've seen in GME shorting fees over the past week. It would seem that if your borrowing costs rose 10 fold you'd move to other investments... but we are seeing nearly the opposite.   My other scattered thoughts are below, curious to know what you think.   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In my opinion we do not currently have accurate short interest numbers, and perhaps never did considering all the potential ways to disguise it. As soon as hedgies knew we relied on that number, it ceased to become a reliable metric.   We all saw Melvin Capital lie about closing their positions pre-squeeze, we all saw CNBC try to divert us with SLV, and we all heard the IB president said if more of those calls were exercised on the 27th/28th it would've crashed everything. We didn't see short fees this high back then, nor did we see no available shares to short like we did on the 25th.  If this blows up we all know the effects it could have on the greater system, and for this reason hedgies are doubling down. In their mind they win both ways, either profiting off shorts by manipulating us all to sell, or getting bailed out by the govt if it all blows up.  Looking at upcoming option contracts: every single expiry has more puts than calls (OI).   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.  Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.  &#x200B;  Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. They tried this last week and failed, and the fight must continue if the squeeze is to be squoze. Call volume is not a useful indicator, it just means a lot of call OI is changing hands back and forth. Next week has put OI of 87,259 and call OI of 65,041.   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.   Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.   Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. I have no clue what the fuck you are talking about.  JUST TELL ME WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD YOLO MY NEXT PAYCHECK."
GF,4,5," Your GF boyfriend gotta be excited Buy your vaccine stonks now guys, I had 'rona over Christmas (a nurse my GF works with in the OR his symptoms for a week, infected half the OR staff and 40 patients; got a slap on the wrist because it's a union gig) so I'm getting every vaccine I can get my hands on. I do NOT want to go through that again and will singlehandedly raise Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson's stock by 0.01 points between now and May. Melvin = The fat friend of your GF who nobody admits to banging but everybody has....including your GF and her boyfriend. If that was to happen...  But yeah, I thought about this of course.  I am a student and don't have much right now.  If it really mooned, I'd but a big portion aside to finish my bachelor's degree because I wouldn't be getting student support anymore, also I'd pay it back.  Then my GF would get that Victoria Secret Bag she dreams of. I see no sense in buying overpriced bags,  but they seem to be relatively stable in worth, even if damaged.  I pondered about what I want for myself. A big laptop?  But I have no real need for that. A new and truly great guitar? I'll better learn to play properly on the one I have first.   I could use a new screen for my desktop PC, One with accurate colors. Apart from that, I'd stock up my emergency funds and invest the rest."
BUL,4,48, BULLISH TECH BULL MARKET UNTIL 2028  STAY IN THE MARKET AND GET RICH BOYS! DON'T BULLY ME DANIEL DON'T BULLY ME DANIEL! If you guys read the actual SEC filing....you would all realize these bonuses specifically were made in cash not shares to not hurt current shareholders.  This is actually goods news because when they report on earnings and more important future guidance I am sure they will say that have raised enough cash to make through the next couple of years. Now that movie theaters are also opening that will help dramatically with burn rate. Tickets in N.Y already sold out completely the weekend of the 6th and 7th. They are reporting on the 8.....Sounds very BULLISH to me.....💪💪
ENTI,4,7509," No. She supports her cause. That's it. She piggy backs to get herself in headlines because she is nothing more than an Instagram thot to leftists and she knows that.   #Here's a recent example:  She joins in Americans anger at Congress for giving a trillion stimulus package that 80% went to Congress' buddies and foreign countries and the other 20% was a measly $600 stfu payment to the people who funded the bill after politicians ruined the country and the economy by shutting the country down.  AOC comes in and acts like *one of us*. Says what we are saying. How bullshit this bill is. How it's over 5k pages and they're only given a few hours to read it before voting. Just how utterly horseshit it all is. Sounds great, right? Yeah AOC! AOC! AOC!!! .....  And then she votes yes for the bill.  She doesn't fight. She doesn't use her *actual power* to help the people or stand up for what is right.  She does what her handlers tell her (which you have to remember is THE ENTIRE PUPROSE OF HER and how she got into office. She was literally a casting call from the DNC to find a minority woman to use as a puppet. Go reread history if you forgot how she was even brought into politics). She has not, nor ever will fight for the people. She will do what her handlers tell her so long as she gets to stay rich and in congress, just like McConnell and Pelosi.   She will make all the tweets in the world to get her exposure, then vote against us every time. Look at her voting record. You cannot argue against this.   This is arguably *worse* than someone who just tells us to fuck off from the start because *at least they're honest* and not betrayers.   Another comparison would be with Maxine. People have been cheering her on *just the same as AOC* simply because they said something about this situation.  And when it comes down to it.. what happens? wants to fuck retail and protect wall street.  Just like they always do.  We would be better off if we had nobody ""rooting for us"" when they're just going to stab us on the back. Dont let a lion into the sheep's herd just because the lion put on a sheep's mask.  If you really believe in AOC then I have a bridge to sell you.   $AMC $BB $GME to the moon 🚀 I only have 2 measly shares of GME @ over $100 and 20 of AMC at an average of $13. I dont want to buy 200 more of each but.... kinda do.   Please just go ape shit on here and share your honest opinion. I understand that your comments are not financial advice nor do I encourage anyone to use anything you see here as financial advice. I will however read each and every last comment even if I only get one or 2 as expected.   Yours Truly  - Depressed Ape  EDIT - this definitely got more love than I thought it would. I definitely won’t risk my ENTIRE life savings and the reason I say “not financial advice” is cause the SEC is watching and we are all adults that work hard for our money! I know not to risk what can’t be lost and appreciate the sentiment.   Much love to anyone reading and commenting and i’d love to reply to all of you but didn’t think this would get more than 2-3 comments before dying Before I start, I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD, and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized. Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!  **Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.  New York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings  Nasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)  **TLDR;/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didn’t suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies/positions.  **In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.  **TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\*\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\*\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)  **START**  I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, I’ve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.  &#x200B;  [GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https: preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)  If you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are “coincidences” as many have suggested.  **PROCESS**  I calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.  &#x200B;  [Covariance & Correlation Matrices.](https: preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)  [P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https: preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)  The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on “luck” or “chance”. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to “luck”. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.  **So, what does this mean?**  **My opinions.**  To me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.  My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.  **Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**  Anyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.  I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR  **Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much  I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of ""correlation does not imply causation"". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **""strength""** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term ""significant"" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little ""\*"" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims "" helps turn food into cellular energy\*"" while other vitamins make claims with no ""\*"".  In layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.  Also, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.  So with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.  Lastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https: firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.  Other than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!  **Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.  [u\/big\_boolean Graph](https: preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)  For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.  **Edit#3** I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields. If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better. **Pointing out problems/faults is important, but providing actionable solutions even more so!** In **RKT DD Part I**, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. **Refer to RKT DD Part I Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)  In **RKT DD Part II** I discuss Rocket’s infectious culture from an employee’s (my own) perspective and why it will allow them to be the Amazon on Fintech. **Refer to RKT DD Part II Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt\_dd\_part\_ii\_a\_former\_employees\_take\_on\_rockets/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt_dd_part_ii_a_former_employees_take_on_rockets/)     **RKT DD PART III:**  Now I want to address you dumbasses who lump Rocket in with United Wholesale Mortgage Company and Loan Depot.  *LoOk HoW LoAn DePoT aNd UwMc ArE DoInG – MoRtGaGe CoMpAnIeS SuCk*  Listen you simpletons, Rocket Companies OWNS THE ENTIRE HOUSING ECOSYSTEM:  * From the Front end with their **Rocket Homes** business (Zillow, Redfin competitor) * To the origination of the loan via **Rocket Mortgage** (whether direct to consumer or through their broker channel) * To their **Amrock** title insurance business which orders the appraisals and title insurance * To their **Nexsys Solutions** with tools that allow for Remote Online Notarization, enabling the mortgage process to be 100% digital * And with their **servicing business** which allows them to think about their clients on a lifetime perspective rather than on just a transactional level.  As they continue to grow their entire housing ecosystem, they are also leveraging their tech platform for other ancillary businesses such as Rocket Loans and Rocket Auto.  Link to all of Rocket’s companies below:  [https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/](https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/)  **Let’s talk Rocket Auto:**  Investors mistakenly think that Rocket Auto hasn’t launched Yet. It’s true Rocket Auto hasn’t launched *publicly* but it doesn’t mean Rocket Auto hasn’t launched. **Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales, marketing and customer service.** Rocket even powers their e-commerce platform. They literally run every part of Vroom’s business except for the delivery of the vehicle.  If you look at VROOM’s 10Q, you’ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4-year agreement with VRM. The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8,641,914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four-year period, in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket’s e-commerce platform. That’s $430M worth of shares. Let’s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom (2015) so we don’t even know how much he already owns. See section of Vroom’s 10Q below:  *Paragraph in VRM 10Q: “On May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Rocket”) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the “Rocket Auto” brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the “RA Agreement”). The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform, but all sales of the Company’s inventory will be conducted through the Company’s platform.* ***Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2021*** *and, during the term of the RA Agreement, Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory. The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company’s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement.* ***The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period*** *based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.”*  As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter…and **what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday’s earnings report?** A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don’t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted.  I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom – why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn’t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it’s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly.  **Why is used car sales good for Rocket?**  Because Data, Data, Data.  Rocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans  Rocket can very easily have access to half of America’s homeowners credit reports by 2030 – The jackpot of consumer data.  What does a credit report tell you? **It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off.** This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform.  Look at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana’s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket’s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket’s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus – to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world’s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate.  Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes **1 million decisions per day** and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions.  Not to mention, ***Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales***\*\*.\*\* We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep – and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana’s presence.  **Rocket Homes:**  *WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW:*  Dear smooth brain, please download “Rocket Homes” on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow.  I’ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won’t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes.  I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket’s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial).  Not going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B – A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET’s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED.  **Rocket’s expansion internationally:**  Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B.  We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country.  Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket’s Lendesk fits the Bill.  Unfortunately these dumbass mods won’t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/) Link below:  [https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  This international expansion (along with Rocket’s other ancillary businesses) highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started.  **Short Squeeze**  Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares – but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares.  Despite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market.  To combat this unnecessary shorting, **Rocket announced a $1B buyback**; currently their float is $2B.  First off, who even announces a buyback when they’ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of.  Rocket’s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday’s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover?  Initially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn’t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn’t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August – that’s how much he believes in this company.  Gilbert has a big ego – so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron’s Fathead to Benedict Arnold’s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America’s biggest traitor*. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below:  [https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/](https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/)  This was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect.  Just like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I’m sure he’s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close).  Fun fact – even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James’ departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship… Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000](https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000)  **But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren’t they buying back shares at these these levels?**  Answer: because they likely can’t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain.  According to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading.  What is material information? Material information is any information that hasn’t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released.  What is Rocket's ""non-public material information"":  * The announcement of Rocket’s big, new financial partner * The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto  This information is likely to be made public on Thursday’s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float. And to put fuel on the fire, Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back, that is, if there are any shares left for purchase.  Gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs, imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into.  Say it with me now: Rocket Bears are Fucked.  TDLR: this doesn’t contain even a fraction of the information in this DD part three (or DD part one and two) but this dude does a good job summarizing RKT’s situation.

MOS,4,2923," FKN LOVE THIS ONE THE MOST MATE #LETS MAKE THIS THE MOST AWARDED AND UPVOTED REDDIT POST EVER BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS.""

HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK. **First, I am not a financial analyst or am I here to advise on what to do, here to just share my personal insights for discussion/entertainment purposes only. I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

Is this the code for not getting financial advice from monkeys dipping crayons in glue, specifically the green kind Very long post summarising hundreds of years worth of short squeezes.  Edited for formatting.  Positions: GME 65 shares @ $105.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/eddie-gilbert-the-boy-wonder-of-wall-street#:~:text=On%20June%2012%2C%201958%2C%20the,remaining%2050%25%20of%20Bruce%20stock.  Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.  The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis  Saunders vs. the Shorts Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.   The Shorts Are Cornered Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.   Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.   https: www.americanheritage.com/jacob-schiff-and-northern-pacific-corner#2  In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.  Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.  On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.  Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.  By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.  Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.  The New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.  https: www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26 https: www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.  Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.  At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.  VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.  The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.  In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.  “The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.  “In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”  Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.  Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.  “We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”  Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.  It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”  Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.  The “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.  Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.  “Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.  Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.  Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.  VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING? Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.  This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.  Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.  “The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.  Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.  But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.  When asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”  The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.  https: www.marketwatch.com/story/squeeze-on-goldman-put-falcone-in-penalty-box-2013-08-21  Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.  He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.  In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.  Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.  It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.  As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.  In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.  Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.  Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)  This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.  That’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.  Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.  The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.  “Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.  I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.  “Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.  https: moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/  [Removed to keep within character limit]  https: nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/  After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.  The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.  But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.  Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.  The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.  Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.  “There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.  Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.  Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”  Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.  Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.  “Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.  Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.  But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.  “We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.  Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.  Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.  Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.  Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.  https: medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d  The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.  At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.  With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.  Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.  Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda: “Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.” This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.  Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.  Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.  Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned. Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.  Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.  From The Great Game:  “Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”  Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”  Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”  Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.  “The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‘short of Harlem’, meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’” People don't seem to fully appreciate HOW many options are VERY CLOSE to being in the money expiring today.

Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.  The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis  Saunders vs. the Shorts Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.   The Shorts Are Cornered Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.   Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.   https: www.americanheritage.com/jacob-schiff-and-northern-pacific-corner#2  In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.  Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.  On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.  Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.  By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.  Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.  The New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.  https: www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26 https: www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.  Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.  At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.  VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.  The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.  In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.  “The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.  “In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”  Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.  Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.  “We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”  Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.  It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”  Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.  The “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.  Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.  “Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.  Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.  Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.  VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING? Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.  This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.  Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.  “The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.  Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.  But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.  When asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”  The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.  https: www.marketwatch.com/story/squeeze-on-goldman-put-falcone-in-penalty-box-2013-08-21  Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.  He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.  In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.  Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.  It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.  As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.  In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.  Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.  Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)  This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.  That’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.  Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.  The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.  “Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.  I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.  “Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.  https: moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/  [Removed to keep within character limit]  https: nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/  After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.  The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.  But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.  Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.  The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.  Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.  “There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.  Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.  Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”  Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.  Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.  “Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.  Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.  But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.  “We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.  Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.  Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.  Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.  Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.  https: medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d  The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.  At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.  With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.  Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.  Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda: “Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.” This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.  Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.  Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.  Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned. Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.  Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.  From The Great Game:  “Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”  Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”  Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”  Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.  “The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‘short of Harlem’, meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’” &#x200B;  [This is GME. This is your rocket ship. Its currently fueling up.](https: preview.redd.it/qfw3u6q2qvj61.png?width=3060&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3cd4bcec168e8a068a8de56d40633cb1de77c74)  This is a chart for GME, the price has been adjusted to scale logarithmically to make the trend easier to see and enable us to see all the data points at once. For all you apes out there all that means is the higher you go, the faster you go higher. This trend started in August. It will likely continue as long as Ryan Cohen and the folks he brought over do good work. Now lets address those large spikes.  &#x200B;  [January Ape welcoming party, no despair here.](https: preview.redd.it/x7vxju4trvj61.png?width=3057&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed649938b25bcb7e461ba4ec794d56bbe72fa33)  See this, its a classic example of a textbook speculation bubble (dont panic just breathe and read, if you're having trouble go ask your wifes bf to read it out loud for you.)  [See](https: preview.redd.it/syvpt1m4tvj61.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e65377fc7cfcbd212a6ff8ca714ca330fedf02e)  So a speculation bubble occurred, but why? What caused it and what does that mean going forward? Especially with the recent activity yesterday and today.  Firstly I am not a financial advisor, and I don't give financial advice.  Secondly to answer is pretty simple this was caused by millions of apes rushing to the stock market to buy GME duh. News goes viral about the squeeze the apes buy, paper hands sell. Ok but that sounds really bad right? Again not necessarily. Bubbles like this happen all the time on all just about anything that can be traded over time scales ranging from a few hours to a few months. One of the things that makes GME such unique opportunity is that there is an incredibly tiny number of available shares relative to its market cap. This important for the squeze but it also means the price is more susceptible to dramatic price fluctuations. In fact it is this property that make a squeeze possible, its the nitrous in your gas that turns it into rocket fuel. Imagine you and all your neighbors are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and everyday you get 10 gallons of water to share between you that no big deal but what happens when 10 gallons turns to 9 then 8 then 7 and so on. the less water (available shares) the more volatile you and your neighbors get until eventually everything goes MAD MAX and you have all the water to yourself.  so the speculation boils down to....is this the Squeeze? did it squouze? am i too late? So what does that mean for the apes that boarded at 200 250 400. Well nothing the Price is going to jump around a lot and every time it should settle a little bit higher than before, all the while costing the shorts more and more interest, until the squeeze goes off or the market value has reached your cost basis and you're wishing you bought more dip so you could have averaged down and made a profit by now.  Additionally if you assume the price jump was in fact speculative bubble it means the shorts couldn't really have covered without guaranteeing rocket launch. those arrogant entitled assholes would have had to look in the mirror admit they lost and launch the rocket themselves. OR they could lie to you, and double down. Historically they double down because its not their personal money and the hate being wrong almost as much as they hate losing money  Personally I don't think the shorts will ever capitulate on their own. I think that it will end in one of 3 ways.  1 SEC will turn up some smoking gun of some kind in an investigation that cant be swept away, and a scapegoat will be offered to the public  2 their clearing house will call their the short positions in and they'll go belly up  3 the shorts are right and we're either too dumb or too distracted to out last them  Just to be clear these are all short term endings. The long term end is basically Cohen and Friends save GAMESTOP and turn it into a digital platform powerhouse, or they don't. They got a pretty good track record though. I mean Chewy sells pet food and toys and its valued at nearly 6 times what GAMESTOP is, don't get me wrong I love my dogs but I spend way more on video games each year than I do on pet food and supplies, and I don't think I'm the only one.  OK, so that covers Jan but what about today and yesterday. Well yeah short answer is I'm not sure, but my best guess is that as a result of some options trading practices someone had to buy a bunch of shares to hedge those options and because the available supply is being restricted by all you apes the price reacted extra sensitively kicking off even more hype. This would be a good sign as it means that the fuel mixture (volatility) is getting super powered and just waiting for the right ignition (catalyst.)  &#x200B;  [Just so you know I where I stand](https: preview.redd.it/bnps5z3z8wj61.png?width=2409&format=png&auto=webp&s=84d2dc21952c6ff352955f0bb9a2c67035185815)  TL;DR I like the stock.

AMC could literally not change or improve a DAMN thing about their business and still reach 5yr highs just because of people flooding the place the first opportunity they get.   Short term, there’s a ton of short interest involved, borrow rates just quadrupled this week, and had 140K options expire in the money yesterday.   Does this make it a guaranteed boom this week? NOPE. Are all the ingredients there for a fantastic run up? You bet.   I made 6000% on previous AMC investments leading up to the first big pop. I have 100+ contracts expiring this week that I hope to go red to green... but I also hold shares @$5.20 that are basically a guaranteed 100%+ return.

Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰  Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:  When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.  RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself).   $RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back.   It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT.   BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?  GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you.   The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.  Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November.   Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.  BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:  Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?    TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌   Edit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40.

It’s true Rocket Auto hasn’t launched *publicly* but it doesn’t mean Rocket Auto hasn’t launched. **Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales, marketing and customer service.** Rocket even powers their e-commerce platform. They literally run every part of Vroom’s business except for the delivery of the vehicle.  If you look at VROOM’s 10Q, you’ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4-year agreement with VRM. The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8,641,914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four-year period, in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket’s e-commerce platform. That’s $430M worth of shares. Let’s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom (2015) so we don’t even know how much he already owns. See section of Vroom’s 10Q below:  *Paragraph in VRM 10Q: “On May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Rocket”) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the “Rocket Auto” brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the “RA Agreement”). The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform, but all sales of the Company’s inventory will be conducted through the Company’s platform.* ***Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2021*** *and, during the term of the RA Agreement, Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory. The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company’s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement.* ***The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period*** *based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.”*  As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter…and **what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday’s earnings report?** A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don’t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted.  I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom – why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn’t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it’s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly.  **Why is used car sales good for Rocket?**  Because Data, Data, Data.  Rocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans  Rocket can very easily have access to half of America’s homeowners credit reports by 2030 – The jackpot of consumer data.  What does a credit report tell you? **It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off.** This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform.  Look at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana’s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket’s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket’s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus – to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world’s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate.  Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes **1 million decisions per day** and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions.  Not to mention, ***Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales***\*\*.\*\* We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep – and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana’s presence.  **Rocket Homes:**  *WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW:*  Dear smooth brain, please download “Rocket Homes” on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow.  I’ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won’t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes.  I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket’s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial).  Not going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B – A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET’s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED.  **Rocket’s expansion internationally:**  Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B.  We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country.  Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket’s Lendesk fits the Bill.  Unfortunately these dumbass mods won’t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/) Link below:  [https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  This international expansion (along with Rocket’s other ancillary businesses) highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started.  **Short Squeeze**  Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares – but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares.  Despite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market.  To combat this unnecessary shorting, **Rocket announced a $1B buyback**; currently their float is $2B.  First off, who even announces a buyback when they’ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of.  Rocket’s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday’s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover?  Initially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn’t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn’t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August – that’s how much he believes in this company.  Gilbert has a big ego – so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron’s Fathead to Benedict Arnold’s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America’s biggest traitor*. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below:  [https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/](https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/)  This was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect.  Just like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I’m sure he’s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close).  Fun fact – even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James’ departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship… Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000](https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000)  **But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren’t they buying back shares at these these levels?**  Answer: because they likely can’t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain.  According to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading.  What is material information? Material information is any information that hasn’t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released.  What is Rocket's ""non-public material information"":  * The announcement of Rocket’s big, new financial partner * The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto  This information is likely to be made public on Thursday’s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float. And to put fuel on the fire, Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back, that is, if there are any shares left for purchase.  Gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs, imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into.  Say it with me now: Rocket Bears are Fucked.  TDLR: this doesn’t contain even a fraction of the information in this DD part three (or DD part one and two) but this dude does a good job summarizing RKT’s situation.

FLO,4,1396," WOOOOOOOOOOO   100K IS THE FLOOR LETS GOO  not financial advice, i eat crayons Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰  Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:  When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.  RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself).   $RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back.   It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT.   BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?  GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you.   The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.  Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November.   Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.  BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:  Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?    TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌   Edit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40.

Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.  Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90  &#x200B;  Edit: This is not financial advice I am retarded but I like this stock  Edit: As of 3:15 today the short interest has increased from 38% to 81%"

DTE,4,9," You selling 30 DTE? OR buy 0DTE calls on OPEX that way Theta doesn't affect you ;) 57% short volume is due probably in large part to dynamic delta gamma hedging by market makers, and momentum algorithm bots from quantitative funds. There were 300,000 0DTE feb 26 contracts open all day yesterday. That's insane and it means 30,000,000 shares of the underlying are pinned to the options market.  As the price of the underlying moves around, market makers need to buy shares, sell shares, buy back sold short shares, or sell short shares to zero out their delta.  300,000 0DTE contracts is insane. Because of how they hedge, this forms a massive structure or system with somewhat predictable outcomes. The share price is a derivative of option order flows, and option order flows are a derivative of the share price. In physics that looks like the wave equation. The result is you get fuck tons of all sorts of volume, because outside buying disturbs the system.  On Thursday around noon, I correctly predicted GME to $105 at close by Friday, by analyzing option order flows, put call skew, and the sheer outsized affect they have on the underlying of GME. Wow, I had AMC 1DTE too which expired worthless yesterday, but I only put in $700. Are you seriously telling me you put 100k into GME options AFTER the pop w 1400% IV?   Wow..."

CX,4,12," AMCX debacle play... or not? Some of you may know that AMCX spiked on Friday. There's many that believe it was from lost Apes buying the wrong ticker.

If its played short because a bunch of people bought the wrong ticker then great, puts and shorts will print.  BUT...

The report was good, and on paper AMCX had a higher short ratio and higher short interest than AMC.  I think I said this before, but it was ripe to squeeze a bit.  Short interest has ""come down"" to 29.02, which is still high, but it's also come down for all of the most shorted stocks in the past few weeks.

TBH I’ve always wondered if the original mistake was people buying AMC instead of AMCX not the other way around.  Anyway I expect the price will drift lower but I’d buy puts, not short, just in case. It’s still 4 days to cover."

What would happen, if the CBOE goes broke? Ey my fellow autistic degenerated fuckdolls.    * Wall street still view Gamestop as a brick and mortar company and bases their estimates on that. The neurodegenerative boomers are slowly waking up and this view is gradually changing. **When they finally understand that this is an e-commerce company the estimates and valuation *will* change.**  * Hedge funds and other **institutions *keeps* shorting**. Some are trapped and have no choice and others see it as a high risk high reward play. But we have hedge funds on our side as well. And they will help us reach escape velocity. The problem is not hedge funds, it's being able to short 140%.  * **Lots of options are ITM** and the total open interest is insanely high. It is rumored that CBOE is suspiciously quite about this.  * Since most of us are holding **the traded (real) shares is very low**. Some have mentioned 10m shares.  * No one thinks Gamestop will be the next Amazon. **But envision them having 1/10th of Amazon's market cap in a year or three.** That would put the share price at around 2000 dead presidents.  * **Ryan Cohen *is* taking over.** He built Chewy from nothing. He is in his fucking prime. This time he is not starting from zero.   * **ETF's *need* to buy more Gamestop** as the valuation grows to balance their funds.  * **There is *a lot* of money circulating at the moment.** The craziest bull market ever seen.

AMZN,4,216," Everyone should understand that markets are pulling back because of margin calls not fricken interest rates. I’m buying call options on $RTX $RKT $BB $BA $TSLA $AMZN $BABA $JD $PYPL. Trillions are sitting on sidelines and are about to be put to work. I believe we are about to witness a huge bull run. Don’t even get me started on Home prices hitting higher highs. My hedge are $SPXU and $VXX calls as well. Gl on making the $3 mil back but I’m positive you’ll be back on top before eoy. When I get vaccinated I’ll be back playing baccarat as well. 🍻 In all seriousness though, would AMZN even buy AMC? Didn't this whole rumor start out of pure speculation like 2 years ago? I bought a couple of AMZN 3200 calls expecting a bounce in tech. Problem is they expire Mar5. Pray for me TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.  # Premise:  Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https: www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.  But let me try to explain nonetheless.  1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https: www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields. 2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https: www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher. 3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something. 4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https: www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https: www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)    1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.    2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https: www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.       1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on. 5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think). 6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently. 7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.    1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https: www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income. 8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.  # Conclusion  Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:  This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.  Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade, I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.  ^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to retards on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)  Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.  * Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening. * We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon. * Black swan events. * Think of something yourself man! This was a long ass post and I am getting late for finishing my day's work."
SFT,4,221," Oi you fuckin worm, my first meme on this account was during the MSFT fiasco, and I used to have another account where I was shitposting back when apple hit 1T the first time. Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd. I don't know what that number puports to show but it is either an error or meaningless.  Trying pulling up the same information from that site for AAPL or MSFT and you will see mutual fund ownership above 1000%.

AMCX,4,12," AMCX debacle play... or not? Some of you may know that AMCX spiked on Friday. There's many that believe it was from lost Apes buying the wrong ticker. But it could have been because of the upbeat earnings call they had prior to market open.  Is anyone thinking of putting in a short or options play against this sudden spike?  Seems like an appropriate play to talk about in the bets forum because of the risk involved. If its played short because a bunch of people bought the wrong ticker then great, puts and shorts will print.  BUT... If it spiked in legit fashion from the earnings call rather than way ward Apes buying the wrong stock.... well, that's a lot of premium and buyback to gobble up the bank account.  I know everyone just upvotes memes and 🦍🧠💎✋🚀🚀🚀🍌 but every once in a while its fun to get quasi cerebral.      Show me your thoughts and/or THOTS ? It's not wayward apes. The report was good, and on paper AMCX had a higher short ratio and higher short interest than AMC.  I think I said this before, but it was ripe to squeeze a bit.  Short interest has ""come down"" to 29.02, which is still high, but it's also come down for all of the most shorted stocks in the past few weeks.  [https: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15b\_amlFiX1bwpsl1ysrk3SAzNsFMIllLgfilBS0f7jQ/edit#gid=1415361390](https: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15b_amlFiX1bwpsl1ysrk3SAzNsFMIllLgfilBS0f7jQ/edit#gid=1415361390) They had great earnings and it’s a highly shorted stock with low float (though a significant amount of shorts have covered in the past month). TBH I’ve always wondered if the original mistake was people buying AMC instead of AMCX not the other way around.  Anyway I expect the price will drift lower but I’d buy puts, not short, just in case.

The problem is not hedge funds, it's being able to short 140%.  * **Lots of options are ITM** and the total open interest is insanely high.

GAN,3,6520, G M E GANG 300k IN SHARES. ANOTHER 10k IN FDS. GME GANG 💎👐😎 QTRADE GANG
EME,3,3279, GME IS A MEME STOCK It won’t rise as high as GME BUT it is still a MEME stock and will squeeze too. At the same time! :) I’m already invested in both and I’m up thousands because I bought the shares a couple weeks ago. I bought the calls and puts expiring in April and it’s carrying my entire portfolio to the moon (even after the dip)  Edit: I haven’t lost any money and I’m still up. You can do this too :) *Gets Squoze*  ^Goddammit!  Seriously? Naked shorts? **THATS THE OLDEST SCHEME IN THE BOOK!** I’m a retard!  #IM MORE RETARDED THAN ANY OF YOU!
IONS,3,78," How can you honestly believe 100K or even 50K is possible?  If it got anywhere close to that level you are talking market cap of TRILLIONS of dollars, higher than the GDP of the USA, about on par with the total value of the entire market.  Even if it somehow magically inflated to this level, do you really think any of us would actually see any of it, they are going to somehow be able to just start handing BILLIONS of dollars to the average investor? I’m all in as well but seeing the disconnect from reality in some of these posts is just mind blowing to me. Maybe a little bit of both honestly.... I think initially they were on the losing side big time and I’m almost 100% certain that they covered quite a bit when people were unable to purchase shares of conveniently restricted companies on many different platforms and market manipulation was rampant only allowing people to sell and not buy and raising margin requirements forcing positions to be closed and driving the price Down I saw a very similar thing happened in 2011 when Silver and Gold Hit all time highs and they raised margin requirements on SLV AND GLD many times over in order to suppress the price and force people to close positions and it worked That combined with the FEDS quantitative easing and buying mortgage backed securities to keep interest rates low and money cheap encouraging spending to give this false illusion that the economy is fine and running on all cylinders.... Anyway no one can know for certain if the hedge funds have been buying call positions to cover their shorts, I’m almost certain they are,.... however it might not just be the hedge funds that are shorting the stocks any longer I feel like a lot more retail investors also started shorting these stocks just as much as the people who are buying it and one thing is for certain stock can go infinitely higher but it only can go so low, plus with all the exposure all over the Internet and television/news outlets over the past 2 months talking about these meme stocks being a joke they might as well just be encouraging regular retail investors on TV to short these (MEME) companies and capitalize on the retail investor shorting this time while holding and adding to long positions themselves hence possibly screwing over the retail investor in the opposite direction this time.  Again this is all speculation but there’s a lot of short interest still in these stocks and it’s coming from somebody and we can capitalize on it again. I’ll be honest I really feel like a lot of these hedge funds probably closed ALOT BUT NOT ALL SHORT POSITIONS and covered their short positions when many of these brokerages were preventing people from buying and the price dropped like a rock it only makes sense it was a short window for them and I’m almost 100% sure they capitalized on it who is shorting the stocks right now?... Who knows but somebody is and there are a lot of them and when the stocks go up it’s a very bad time for them. Next week should be exciting The fed pumped TRILLIONS into the market last year along with all time low interest rates and bad bond rates.  This year will be the true test for her funds. Go through and see how many of her picks were penny stocks last year, before she pumped 100m into each to bring them into the teens.  I think she'd be better off doing a fire sale on all of her overpriced crap and start pumping new penny stocks."
NEX,3,75," Your mention of loaning crazy DTI ratios in 2008 paralells the nearly 10 fold increase we've seen in GME shorting fees over the past week. It would seem that if your borrowing costs rose 10 fold you'd move to other investments... but we are seeing nearly the opposite.   My other scattered thoughts are below, curious to know what you think.   \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In my opinion we do not currently have accurate short interest numbers, and perhaps never did considering all the potential ways to disguise it. As soon as hedgies knew we relied on that number, it ceased to become a reliable metric.   We all saw Melvin Capital lie about closing their positions pre-squeeze, we all saw CNBC try to divert us with SLV, and we all heard the IB president said if more of those calls were exercised on the 27th/28th it would've crashed everything. We didn't see short fees this high back then, nor did we see no available shares to short like we did on the 25th.  If this blows up we all know the effects it could have on the greater system, and for this reason hedgies are doubling down. In their mind they win both ways, either profiting off shorts by manipulating us all to sell, or getting bailed out by the govt if it all blows up.  Looking at upcoming option contracts: every single expiry has more puts than calls (OI).   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.  Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.  &#x200B;  Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. They tried this last week and failed, and the fight must continue if the squeeze is to be squoze. Call volume is not a useful indicator, it just means a lot of call OI is changing hands back and forth. Next week has put OI of 87,259 and call OI of 65,041.   Of all the call options with 1000 OI or above, 4 out of 16 are currently ITM.   Of all the put options with 1000 OI or above, every single one is OTM, with the greatest OI in $20/$30/$40/$50 strikes respectively.   Let me remind you that these expire NEXT WEEK. There are clear plans laid out here to profit MASSIVELY from a decrease in gme price, and erase the gains from currently ITM options. I have no clue what the fuck you are talking about.  JUST TELL ME WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD YOLO MY NEXT PAYCHECK."
SENS,3,6," I have been “selling puts” on stocks you want to own anyways. You get paid a premium, and if the stock is below the price at expiration you are obligated to buy 100 shares. If you find a cheaper stock under $5 (I’ve been playing SENS), the most exposure you would have is $300-500. Then you own 100 shares on the stock and can sell covered calls to get premium going the other way.   It’s a very basic play that has pretty limited risk if you don’t mind owning 100 shares of a stock for a long hold. NAKD, CTRM, or even SENS before BB. Ouch a SENS 7 call on April tho"
ROKU,3,1234," ROKU better recover or else I’m fucked $FUBO is a sports based streaming service that's now rolling out their own sportsbook.  Stream the game - bet on the game - all in the same app.  ER is coming Tuesday of next week. They've raised guidance **TWICE** prior to this earnings report.  We just had the SuperBowl - and March Madness is almost here, the subs are going to be up so bigly over the last Q it will blow your wives boyfriend for her.  The growth potential of FUBO is massive, its another changing of the tides moment where Americans are ditching cable TV providers in favor of streaming services. Think **NFLX**, **ROKU**, etc.. they've all replaced their archaic counterparts. **This is just the streaming end of the business.**  Now factor in the sports betting aspect ( **DKNG**, **PENN**, etc ) and the added value of doing all of this from the same fucking app. Sports betting is slowly rolling out across the entire country.   Its a perfect storm of fundamentals that support the bull case for FUBO.   &#x200B;  FUBO's current subscriber base is **500k paid subs**, but check this out:  >""About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.""  Thats approx. 220 MILLION sports fans in the us and 190 MILLION who have gambled in the past year.  Lets throw some modesty in here and say FUBO could capture **5%** of this market, aka **\~ 10 MILLION**  **20x their current subscriber base.** 20. Fucking. Times.  Thats if they capture 5% of the market which is pretty fucking reasonable considering there is very limited competition on the sports streaming side of things.  &#x200B;  Alright now let me really fuck you up....  &#x200B;  Lets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:  FUBO MARKET CAP: **$3.5 billion**  * NFLX - **$240 billion** * ROKU - **$50 billion** * DKNG - **$25 billion** * PENN - **$18 billion**  I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..  **FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR**  &#x200B;  There is also the potential for a short squeeze. I know u retards love short squeezes.  * **53mm float** * **28 % short** * **Assuming an average \~ $40 entry for shorts**  &#x200B;  Fubo squeezed during the geemmmeee saga and is now associated with the meme stocks, FUBO is not a fuckin meme, its a motherfucker of a growth stock that has now turned into a powder keg.

RRR,3,114," JPOW GO BRRRRRRRRRR WITH THE BOIS? ARRRRRR MOTHER FUCKERS!!! ALL ABORD THE APES SHIP!!! WE GOT A TREASURE ISLAND TO TAKE!!!!! THE JOURNEY TAKES US DEEP TO THE FUCKING BOTTOM BUT DAVID JONES WILL NOT CATCH US. WIND AND OCEAN FAVORED US!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Good morning my fellow degenerates, hope you all are in good health and spirit.   ***TLDR: Shorting bonds could be one hell of a play. Shorting emerging market foreign junk grade - corporate bonds might be the fucking moonshot if I'm right.***   Today I want to talk about the most boomer investment there is: Fixed Income securities: or bonds.   So just some background information: Bonds are a debt based security. Meaning that you are loaning a company, municipality or government money in exchange for regular interest payments. But the underlying issue I see is when any significant inflation happens(it's **when** not if, more on this later), and the fed hikes rates, most of the bonds issued now and in the past few years suffer from something called interest rate risk.   Interest rates share an inverse relationship with bonds. So when rates rise --> existing bonds fall. This makes sense because why would you ever keep money in a bond paying x% when the current going rate for bonds is much higher. This kind of market pressure can quickly tank bond prices. Which is why I think shorting certain corporate bonds or ETFs who hold corporate bonds is a good idea.   **Why Inflation is going to spike:**  This topic has been discussed to death here on WSB by the few 🌈🐻who haven't yet been hunted to extinction by JPOW's money printer. Now I'm not going to waste your time and explain in detail every reason I believe (relatively high) inflation is just on the horizon. That being said I'm going to recap the highlights of the core arguments:  M1(Money supply) has increased drastically through quantitative easing, but unlike '08 where they lowered rates through decreasing yields on treasuries, they've also started buying up other debt securities **directly** decreasing yields across the board. They did this to help ease the burden on businesses, and allow them to borrow money for much cheaper. They also did this because the credit market froze and when the debt market freezes you know shit is about to go down. But this time, also unlike '08 the fed went full BRRRRRR and well...  &#x200B;  [Does injecting this much money into the system seem sustainable to you?](https: preview.redd.it/fqcibc65ezj61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d0c2609a617f0bab6205f30d1b90c293dac884e)  &#x200B;  The graph really speaks for itself. So much money has been injected into the economy through the debt markets that bonds yields are practically nothing. The reason we haven't seen that money actually inflate the economy is because the **velocity** **of money** has tanked.   For the retards in the back who fell asleep in econ 101: the velocity of money is the rate at which money changes hands to purchase a good or service within a given timeframe. Because economies all across the world are dampened at the moment with all the restrictions and shutdowns the average consumer is spending much less now than they would otherwise be expected to.   [The velocity of money is going to skyrocket as the economies of the world open back up.](https: preview.redd.it/lvzafh5zfzj61.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=735b0e7796514ed098450521303cb7bfcabf0867)  As all this money, which was previously locked up in households and businesses reenters the economy we'll likely see a sharp uptick in inflation. Now the people who run the federal reserve aren't dumb, they realize that this sharp rise in inflation is bad. The Fed doesn't want to see runaway inflation, and so they'll do whatever they can to counteract the effects of printing this much money.   The most effective way of the fed counteracting all this printing is by creating a big negative liquidity shock. This is known as quantitative tightening. (Read raising interest rates). Which is going to absolutely decimate bond prices.   Which is why credit where credit is due: As a liquidity shock occurs the market usually does sell off so the 🌈🐻 converting to a cash position isn't actually the worst thing you could do. But then again being cash gang means inflation gang is slowly eating your effective capital. It also means you hold a position even more fucking boomer (read: boring as shit) than investing in bonds. Congrats!?  Now that we established what interest rate risk is, how it effects bonds and why we're likely to see a substantial amount of it in the coming months / years, it's time to narrow down the pool of bonds we could short.   Governments across the world are printing money like there's no tomorrow, and this is because the 'growth corrected interest rate' is negative. It's not only negative in Europe and Japan but also much of the developing world. Which means governments there are much likelier to take on higher amounts of debt. Now mathematically speaking this is fine, as long as compound growth outpaces or stays in line with compound interest, this debt is manageable. It becomes less and less of a burden with each subsequent year (inflation). The problem occurs when that growth is strained or when interest rates get hiked.   [Most rates are effectively negative accounting for growth](https: preview.redd.it/7c49p6gckzj61.png?width=318&format=png&auto=webp&s=11be27b9e3264f759ebade62098727b026bb1e75)  I think the prime target is emerging market foreign junk grade - corporate bonds, that are denominated in USD. The reason I say this, is in the event of QT by the fed, there will be a liquidity shock, creating a spike in demand for (US) dollars, which is what the world relies on for most global trade. This makes the dollar gain value in relation to other currencies quite quickly and probably unexpectedly. (Unless the market prices this in, which will see these bonds decrease in value anyway \[making your short position profitable\])  Bonds from companies that primarily do business in local currencies, but hold debt denominated in dollars face: Exchange rate risk: If the price of their local currency falls in relation to the US dollar they end up paying much more than expected (in their local currency) to keep up with their payments. If this is not an investment grade bond it means rating agencies think the company has heightened default risk. So this very well could be the straw that breaks the camel's back and bankrupts some of these companies even if they stay solvent I think the increased risk would cause a decent sell off.  **Now because I'm not blind and I see the sentiment on this sub and their views on short selling:**   Unlike Melvin and co I am not over shorting or illegally (naked) short selling a company and directly engineering the failure of these assets / companies. I am merely using the data available to me and making a bet on where bond prices will be in a few years time. If I enter this trade and / or make money off it I will donate a portion of the winnings to a charity that operates within the emerging markets I shorted.   **Why the fuck are you telling me this now if this isn't going to happen for a while?**  Because the sooner individual investors recognize the opportunity, the sooner individual investors can pick the best targets. Furthermore all of this is for naught if rate hikes are priced in before individual investors enter their short position.  **tHiS iS aLrEaDy PrIcEd iN**  No the fuck it isn't. Why do you think there's usually a market selloff and downward pressure on debt markets directly following rate hike announcements? Unless the news is ridiculously old most of the time it isn't priced in. I watched you retards claim Disney + was priced in for weeks and I still saw Disney's stock spike on rollout day.   **DISCLAIMERS:**  Disclaimer: I am not as familiar with debt markets as I am with derivative and equity markets so I may have missed something obvious. There's a reason I post this shit before I actually call my broker to initiate the short position. **I am also not a certified financial advisor**, investment in any security poses risk. Not all positions are suitable for all investors. Keep your goals, needs and risk appetite in mind before you invest.   Disclaimer 2: Shorting debt instruments like bonds carries hidden interest payment risk: You're liable for paying the interest payments until you close out of your short position. Bonds are also much less liquid than stocks, so finding bonds to close out your position could be difficult. Shorting is also an unlimited risk strategy. So idk maybe buy calls on the bonds to hedge.   Let me know what you think! Am I the next Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry or the most retarded thing this sub has seen since Robinhood box spreads? I don't want to go full retard so I figured I'd let you glorious autists critique my position. Tell me if / how I'm wrong etc."

GMED,3,692," >GMED didn't trend?  A bunch of us were talking about it, but we got the ticker wrong and accidentally bought $GME. GMED 🚀 lol I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.  By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.  Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/  First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!!   Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink.   Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here.   By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.  Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.  When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.  UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!  Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.  Space Ape out  TLDR:   * $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU * $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI * $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot * $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds * $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon  EDIT: Fresh data in.... Added Wendys and the 100k moon prediction"

LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE APES OF THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH ONCE UPON A TIME BOARDED A ROCKETSHIP AND FUCKING BLEW IT INTO MOTHERFUCKING SPACE AND LANDED ON PLUTO AND STUCK A $GME FLAG INTO THE GROUND OF SAID PLANET!"
AMBO,3,94," LAMBO OR FOODSTAMPS 🕶 [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates Did you look at what the RAMBO companies did on earnings day?   Because if things are evolving into earnings press release -> investors day and the trad conference call is dying, you might be on to something."

NX,3,81," Lisa Su CEO of AMD purchased XLNX back in Oct. 2020 for 35B in cash since then the deal has been killed off, then back on and now it’s going through review.   With any month now AMD and XLNX will merge completely under on ticker adding to AMD share price.   AMD is a semiconductor chip manufacturer for Gaming consoles, laptops, cars, and basically anything under the sun that needs a processor(CPU or GPU).   With a chip shortage at hand AMD is in the lead of the semi conductor industry increasing profit margins and also leading in stock increase of 45% compared to NVDA 35% and INTL up 8%.   Chip shortage is to be solved once AMD releases and showcases their new Radeon RX 6000 GPU (Radeon RX 6700 Series) March 3 this is to give an alternative option NVDA’s unit GeForce RTX 3060.   Lisa Su plans to tackle cars,computers,solar panels, to help end the semiconductor shortage (Biden executive order that gives Semiconductor companies and their suppliers 47B to ramp up production for semiconductor companies to create vast amounts of semiconductors.)

WEN,3,14839," Where does OP get their data?  I invested in WEN because I thought it was a secret, because everyone at WSB mention’s Wendy’s all the time, but it’s not on these charts.  ...  down 11.17%  When’s it gonna pop?  WEN to the moon! MOTHER FUCKIN WENDY'S Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
SUMO,3,5," I ‘member this stock.  And SUMO and SNOW  I miss those days. I also have some SUMO, but that space is very crowded.  I think SNOW is too hot and am afraid it may fall hard if they disappoint on earnings so I have avoided them. I bought SUMO on a dip and sold on a peak because I honestly just wanted to get out of that space. It’s too crowded and too competitive.  I agree though, SNOW was over valued imo since IPO, just a billionaire-backed over-hyped stock. It probably will end up falling hard. So I’ve stayed far away from that one too."

My hedge are $SPXU and $VXX calls as well. Gl on making the $3 mil back but I’m positive you’ll be back on top before eoy. When I get vaccinated I’ll be back playing baccarat as well. 🍻 Buy the dips. And getting VIX/VXX calls and SPY puts. Don't forget VXX calls

MONEY IN THE BANK 🚀🚀🚀 >that the Market Maker / big money (usually) that sold you your call pretty much always delta hedges, meaning they buy to cover their call liability incrementally as the price comes ITM. This is what drives a gamma squeeze: as calls come ITM, those with call liability buy shares to hedge, ad  Let me help!     If the options contract is IN THE MONEY then there is ALWAYS A BUYER! If you don't exercise it then you SELL it! To whom!? There is ALWAYS a buyer if is ITM. Usually the last buyers are COMPUTERS. They will buy your contracts for the smallest profit, exercise it and instantly sell it. They do that in microseconds. If the strike was $8 and the stock was $8.01 (like AMC) good enough! They exercise those instantly and re-sell them for $8.011. Remember you can early exercise too, so this happens a lot. I know, right? Totally lame. I knew my karma was going to take a beating but I just wanted to offer another facts-based perspective that wasn't ""DUMP YOUR MONEY IN URANIUM MINES FOR GUARANTEED GAINS!""

THR,3,121," HE DEFECATED THROUGH A SUNROOF Wait wait wait,  so this smooth brain mfr wrote a 3mil check to cover a loss on a loan,  BUT DUMB ASS COULDN'T DROP 3MIL INTO GME STOCK AND HELP IGNITE THE THRUSTERS ON THIS ROCKET??!!??  Tldr: you sir, are truly retarded Courtesy of u/brawnerboy  I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https: www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)  If you haven't already, you should read it.  Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.  Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90  &#x200B;  Edit: This is not financial advice I am retarded but I like this stock  Edit: As of 3:15 today the short interest has increased from 38% to 81%"
ENS,3,14831," NAKD, CTRM, or even SENS before BB. Ouch a SENS 7 call on April tho Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
WNS,3,303," I lost it when the announcer said ""HE'S A BILLIONAIRE AND HE OWNS THIS COMPANY!"" FFS NO ONE CARES ABOUT UR TERRIBLE GME AND AMC PLAYS BRUH YOU FUCKING CLOWNS ARE RUINING WSB In **RKT DD Part I**, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. **Refer to RKT DD Part I Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)  In **RKT DD Part II** I discuss Rocket’s infectious culture from an employee’s (my own) perspective and why it will allow them to be the Amazon on Fintech. **Refer to RKT DD Part II Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt\_dd\_part\_ii\_a\_former\_employees\_take\_on\_rockets/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt_dd_part_ii_a_former_employees_take_on_rockets/)     **RKT DD PART III:**  Now I want to address you dumbasses who lump Rocket in with United Wholesale Mortgage Company and Loan Depot.  *LoOk HoW LoAn DePoT aNd UwMc ArE DoInG – MoRtGaGe CoMpAnIeS SuCk*  Listen you simpletons, Rocket Companies OWNS THE ENTIRE HOUSING ECOSYSTEM:  * From the Front end with their **Rocket Homes** business (Zillow, Redfin competitor) * To the origination of the loan via **Rocket Mortgage** (whether direct to consumer or through their broker channel) * To their **Amrock** title insurance business which orders the appraisals and title insurance * To their **Nexsys Solutions** with tools that allow for Remote Online Notarization, enabling the mortgage process to be 100% digital * And with their **servicing business** which allows them to think about their clients on a lifetime perspective rather than on just a transactional level.  As they continue to grow their entire housing ecosystem, they are also leveraging their tech platform for other ancillary businesses such as Rocket Loans and Rocket Auto.  Link to all of Rocket’s companies below:  [https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/](https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/)  **Let’s talk Rocket Auto:**  Investors mistakenly think that Rocket Auto hasn’t launched Yet. It’s true Rocket Auto hasn’t launched *publicly* but it doesn’t mean Rocket Auto hasn’t launched. **Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales, marketing and customer service.** Rocket even powers their e-commerce platform. They literally run every part of Vroom’s business except for the delivery of the vehicle.  If you look at VROOM’s 10Q, you’ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4-year agreement with VRM. The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8,641,914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four-year period, in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket’s e-commerce platform. That’s $430M worth of shares. Let’s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom (2015) so we don’t even know how much he already owns. See section of Vroom’s 10Q below:  *Paragraph in VRM 10Q: “On May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Rocket”) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the “Rocket Auto” brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the “RA Agreement”). The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform, but all sales of the Company’s inventory will be conducted through the Company’s platform.* ***Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2021*** *and, during the term of the RA Agreement, Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory. The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company’s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement.* ***The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period*** *based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.”*  As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter…and **what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday’s earnings report?** A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don’t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted.  I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom – why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn’t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it’s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly.  **Why is used car sales good for Rocket?**  Because Data, Data, Data.  Rocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans  Rocket can very easily have access to half of America’s homeowners credit reports by 2030 – The jackpot of consumer data.  What does a credit report tell you? **It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off.** This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform.  Look at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana’s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket’s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket’s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus – to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world’s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate.  Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes **1 million decisions per day** and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions.  Not to mention, ***Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales***\*\*.\*\* We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep – and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana’s presence.  **Rocket Homes:**  *WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW:*  Dear smooth brain, please download “Rocket Homes” on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow.  I’ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won’t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes.  I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket’s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial).  Not going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B – A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET’s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED.  **Rocket’s expansion internationally:**  Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B.  We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country.  Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket’s Lendesk fits the Bill.  Unfortunately these dumbass mods won’t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/) Link below:  [https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  This international expansion (along with Rocket’s other ancillary businesses) highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started.  **Short Squeeze**  Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares – but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares.  Despite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market.  To combat this unnecessary shorting, **Rocket announced a $1B buyback**; currently their float is $2B.  First off, who even announces a buyback when they’ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of.  Rocket’s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday’s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover?  Initially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn’t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn’t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August – that’s how much he believes in this company.  Gilbert has a big ego – so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron’s Fathead to Benedict Arnold’s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America’s biggest traitor*. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below:  [https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/](https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/)  This was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect.  Just like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I’m sure he’s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close).  Fun fact – even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James’ departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship… Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000](https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000)  **But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren’t they buying back shares at these these levels?**  Answer: because they likely can’t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain.  According to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading.  What is material information?

NES,3,1687," Hey folks! I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.  Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:  So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101). I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:     TL;DR: You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.    Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic. Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:  you start with ~0~ shares you borrow one from a broker you now have ~1~ shares you sell that share, completing your short you now have ~0~ shares  Now imagine the short squeeze happens. And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc. The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).  Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high: Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital.  You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.  you start with ~0~ shares you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker! you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!  Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with!  Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value:   THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?  Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy. Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.   If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations. Now think about that again.   Effective TL;DR 2.0:  People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule? Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.  But here’s MY question: What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it?  VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.   Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not. Joy to all, ~Unimportant   (this is not financial advise, and I am not a financial advisor) ARRRRRR MOTHER FUCKERS!!! ALL ABORD THE APES SHIP!!! WE GOT A TREASURE ISLAND TO TAKE!!!!!

LEAS,3,34," There is absolutely the possibility we don’t see stimmies for AT LEAST another month. We’re becoming wayyy too reliant on those checks becoming a reality. **First, I am not a financial analyst or am I here to advise on what to do, here to just share my personal insights for discussion/entertainment purposes only. I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.  Do your own diligence, do not message me on what to do or not to do, hate or love me, I am just sharing it here since I got banned on other subreddit for mentioning a digital currency couple of times in a row, lol.  **To end, I believe this company is undervalued, shorted, earning transcript showed me they are bound to comeback, good for short term small gains and long-term big gains.**  EDIT2: Obligatory rockets for people that cannot read   **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Sources (too lazy to copy links):  Finviz, Yahoo Finance, Gurufocus, ROOTs website, opinions/posts of analysts back in November and one in December.

They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

AVA,3,14850," Shorting has its merits, but in my opinion there needs to be transparency as well as a hard cap on the % of float that can be shorted. Shorting is too easy for the hedgies to use and abuse which they can and do at will with enough volume to have a noticeably negative impact. They don’t usually do it because of the fundamentals, but for profit. It’s bullshit what they can do to a stock - screwing over honest ppl who actually believe in the stock they invested in by shorting it to increase their profitability. Apple is the most valuable company in the world. They had a great earnings call this month. No reason to lose over 10 bucks of share in value like they have. I saw SAVA and TLRY shoot up in value and close at I think 117 and 65 or so respectively one day. Why? So higher OTM options are rolled out the next day. What happens the next day? Price falls by 50% rendering those OTM calls useless. First time GME shot to 150 - they were allowed to because they stopped shorting for a brief period. Why? To have any limit sells trigger in the 100-150 range and that day 150 was the highest OTM call option available. Shenanigans!! Im just saying: I WILL COMPLETELY SHORT THE STOCK WITH MY WHOLE AVAILABLE MONEY. Don’t care about what you’re doing. But that’s my plan. No financial advice. Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
MSM,3,48," I would take this cats advice on investing before I would take the MSM advice. Your cat is exceptional please find tiny spacesuit for the moon trip, the rocket fits all.

I buy and I hold, don’t care what social media ads /  MSM tries to convince me of. This is getting gnarly and nearly unbelievable. I already had little trust in media and governing bodies before this.   Every piece of information you read , carefully study the language and consider motives of every single chunk of information that you read. Every mind game you could conceive of and more importantly ones you cannot are being used. Protect yourself from bias , positive and negative. It will be used against you.  Anyone reading this knows we are the in the Age of Information and that is now the weapon of choice, information. Falsehoods mixed truth. And truths mixed with falsehoods.   I would love to witness the greatest redistribution of wealth in the history of humanity, the ultra wealthy run this shit. They run the shit but who makes it work? We do , we put in the work. Wageslaves for forever and just be happy with it okay? Save up your money to go to college mkay? Save up your money for a nice place to live will you? Saved up everything you can and it’s never enough? The bank can help you of course.  Nothing will fundamentally change unless we unite. The people, we are fearless, they fear us.   Why doesn’t the larger of the two classes simply not eat the smaller one?   Follow the money.   Think for yourself you damn ass apes."
OSS,3,4367," GME AND KOSS TO THE MOON Hi fellow retards!  My hypothesis and granted this may have already been postulated here is that the hedgers had enough liquidity in Jan to short GME and temper the price back down. Now it appears that they’ve run out of liquidity and are forced to sell their income generating securities to continue to short in an act of desperation.   As a parallel - consider it from a mortgage perspective they’re trying to stave of foreclosure by first burning through savings and now they’re selling off their valuable possessions. So they can’t borrow off margin, they are out of cash and now they’re selling off their source of income. Which by the way hurts the passive investors that like their ETF stocks, but the hedges don’t give a shit. They just want to short GME no matter the cost.   The mortgage allegory reminds me of say the 2008 crisis - I used to be a loan officer and the exotic sub prime mortgages were horse shit. You could qualify for a mortgage back then with a DTI (debt to income ratio) of 65%. For those unaware DTI is the ratio of your GROSS income vs the PITI of your home and all revolving and installment debt on your credit report. It does not factor in payments for utilities, food, gas. So they assume people can afford a house with the 35% of gross fucking income after their monthly debt is paid? No. Now the opposite is happening again. They deserve this for their insatiable greed and lack of compassion for anyone but themselves.   Hedgies have no cash and selling their income generating stocks to continue this fight. Eventually they’ll run out of those and will have no choice but to cover no matter the price. They fucking deserve it. From their ashes I hope we can build a market that is free and open without their influence and heavy shorting a float will be illegal. If I want to pay x dollars for a stock, that’s my business. Shorting is bullshit. Think a company is overvalued? Then close your position and find another fucking stock. The government should be appalled. Trying to BK a company not only puts thousands out of a job, but reduces the income tax stream from them to the gov’t. Not only that but now they’re on the govt payroll via unemployment. All this so they can profit off of destruction. Fuck. You. Long post I’m sorry.  TLDR: hedgies are going to burn for their atrocities.   My position: 914 shares of GME and one 3/5 $100 call. The shares I’d be willing to part with for say a minimum of 4 figures per share. Maybe 5 who knows? 42,069 per share has a nice ring to it. I like the stock and this isn’t financial advice. Hedge funds are cucks. Yeah I regret my KOSS holding rn"
GAYMF,3,28," So I ended up buying $GAYMF because of the hilarious ticker symbol. 2k shares.   I'm riding $GAYMF and I'm not pulling out anytime soon. GME is not a memestock anymore, it became harsh reality.  A meme stock is something like GAYMF (Galway Metals) I’ve done the same GAYMF"
GER,3,13329," APES STRONGER TOGETHER !!!  NO KOBAS It’s not going back to 40$ this is BIGGER money playing Hedge fund shills are spreading disinformation saying $800 is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.  It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.  DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN.  It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. IMAGINE IF YOU HAD SOLD EARLIER THIS WEEK AT $40!  WE CAN STAY RETARDED, LONGER THAN YOU CAN STAY SOLVENT!!"
THC,3,17," Tolerance to weed is now at THC immune GME and THC 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Aphria $APHA cultivates and sells medical and recreational cannabis through retail and wholesale channels in Canada and internationally.     🚀 On Dec. 16, Aphria and Tilray $TLRY announced a merger to form the largest cannabis company in the worldby revenue. The company will keep the Tilray name, including the ability to consolidate production in Canada, combine alcohol and CBD businesses in the United States in preparation for potential federal legalization, and the ability to combine efforts in Europe.    🚀 In a reverse merger structure, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share, implying a 23% premium to Tilray’s share price before the announcement. Given relative sizes, Aphria shareholders will own about 60% of the combined company and get seven of the nine board seats. Tilray CEO and Chairman Brendan Kennedy will get one of Tilray’s two board seats, while Aphria CEO and Chairman Irwin Simon will keep both roles in the combined company.    🚀 Its pending merger with Tilray boosts its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Deal terms seem fair to both sides. Aphria added recreational cannabis after Canada’s legalization in October 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Aphria’s recreational and wholesale cannabis revenue accounted for roughly 41% of total cannabis and distribution revenue. Unlike many of Aphria’s competitors that immediately focused on creating consumer packaged goods for the recreational market, Aphria initially focused on flower and vape. However, it is now beginning to expand into edibles.    🚀 On Feb. 1, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Ron Wyden announced their intentions to push major federal cannabis legislation. They plan to release a discussion draft in the early part of this year. Legalization is likely going to take a couple of years, as forecasts estimate a change to federal law by 2023. Nevertheless, legalization sooner than that would unlock growth and capital access sooner but doesn’t change our estimated market potential of $85 billion by 2030 compared with an estimated $15 billion in 2020, according to the Marijuana Business Daily.    🚀 Aphria has an extensive international distribution business, which generated the majority of net revenue in 2020, a far larger portion than many of its Canadian cannabis peers. The global market looks lucrative given higher realized prices and growing acceptance of the medical benefits of cannabis. Exportersbmust pass strict regulations to enter markets, which protects early entrants like Aphria. Due to climate, much of Canada’s cultivation is in greenhouses or indoors. Recent expansions in outdoor production are likely limited to extracted products due to quality. Aphria revised plans to build production in Colombia due to high capital costs, instead exporting global medical markets from its Canadian facilities.     🚀 Forecast estimate roughly 16% average annual growth through 2030 for the global medicinal market excluding Canada and the U.S. Aphria's 2020 acquisition of SweetWater, a U.S. craft brewery, still leaves it out of the U.S. THC or CBD market. Its strategy appears to predict that future cannabis distribution looks more like alcohol or tobacco than the current multi-state operator strucure of today. The U.S. offers the fastest growth of any market globally. However, the regulatory environment is murky with individual states legalizing cannabis while it remains illegal federally.

LX,3,177," I agree. RBLX and Instacart when it goes public $FUBO is a sports based streaming service that's now rolling out their own sportsbook.  Stream the game - bet on the game - all in the same app.  ER is coming Tuesday of next week. They've raised guidance **TWICE** prior to this earnings report.  We just had the SuperBowl - and March Madness is almost here, the subs are going to be up so bigly over the last Q it will blow your wives boyfriend for her.  The growth potential of FUBO is massive, its another changing of the tides moment where Americans are ditching cable TV providers in favor of streaming services. Think **NFLX**, **ROKU**, etc.. they've all replaced their archaic counterparts. **This is just the streaming end of the business.**  Now factor in the sports betting aspect ( **DKNG**, **PENN**, etc ) and the added value of doing all of this from the same fucking app. Sports betting is slowly rolling out across the entire country.   Its a perfect storm of fundamentals that support the bull case for FUBO.   &#x200B;  FUBO's current subscriber base is **500k paid subs**, but check this out:  >""About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.""  Thats approx. 220 MILLION sports fans in the us and 190 MILLION who have gambled in the past year.  Lets throw some modesty in here and say FUBO could capture **5%** of this market, aka **\~ 10 MILLION**  **20x their current subscriber base.** 20. Fucking. Times.  Thats if they capture 5% of the market which is pretty fucking reasonable considering there is very limited competition on the sports streaming side of things.  &#x200B;  Alright now let me really fuck you up....  &#x200B;  Lets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:  FUBO MARKET CAP: **$3.5 billion**  * NFLX - **$240 billion** * ROKU - **$50 billion** * DKNG - **$25 billion** * PENN - **$18 billion**  I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..  **FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR**  &#x200B;  There is also the potential for a short squeeze. I know u retards love short squeezes.  * **53mm float** * **28 % short** * **Assuming an average \~ $40 entry for shorts**  &#x200B;  Fubo squeezed during the geemmmeee saga and is now associated with the meme stocks, FUBO is not a fuckin meme, its a motherfucker of a growth stock that has now turned into a powder keg. The ""squeeze"" would be backed by fundamentals, and sustained.   &#x200B;  **TLDR:**  **$FUBO TO $200** >ets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:   >   >FUBO MARKET CAP: $3.5 billion   >   >NFLX - $240 billionROKU - $50 billionDKNG - $25 billionPENN - $18 billion   >   >I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..   >   >FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR  FearlessTrader is sweating :)"

COO,3,-10," If you smellllllllllllllllllllll la lalalslalala... what the Rock... is COOKIN'   Edit: added more llllll to smell ￼≡  Redditors, Ryan Cohen Needs Your Help to Send GME Stock Back to $500  2/26/2021 1:32pm EST  By Thomas Yeung, CFA, InvestorPlace Markets Analyst  In 2015, the Financial Times joked that RadioShack, an ailing brick-and-mortar electronics chain, should consider selling fruit baskets or turning its stores into Zumba studios to survive. The retailer had ignored the threat of e-commerce for so long that few believed it could survive. Two years later, RadioShack was virtually no more.  ￼￼  Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com  Today, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock sits at a similar juncture. Since the early 2010s, GME’s top brass had treated the retailer like drunks at an open bar — doling out a princely dividend to shareholders (and stock options to themselves) while cutting reinvestment into aging stores. But then something happened: A group of retail investors, driven by Reddit’s hedge-fund-hatin’ r/WallStreetBets decided to take GME stock from $10 to $480 in a matter of weeks. The people still love GameStop! This love for GameStop and disdain for Wall Street is an unusual combo. It means that, unlike RadioShack in 2015, the video game retailer still has a fighting chance. For the good of GameStop and its shareholders, Reddit investors need to finish the revolution they started. And if they do, Redditors and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) founder Ryan Cohen can still send GME stock back to $500.  GME Stock: Intentionally Driven into a Ditch  Anyone who’s recently visited a GameStop store will tell you the same thing: They look old. And that’s by design. For over a decade, GameStop’s management has enriched shareholders at the expense of the firm. GameStop’s capital expenditure, the budget used to maintain its stores, peaked in 2011 at almost $200 million before getting cut in favor of larger dividends and share buybacks. Meanwhile, the company’s stores have continued to age, and layoffs have continued unabated. Yet, shareholders allowed then-CEO J. Paul Raines to maintain the course. Why? It made them money. Customers, employees and other stakeholders weren’t a priority. And after several failed acquisitions, including game developer Kongregate, GameStop’s management decided that milking the company for cash was a better bet. The firm’s blind commitment to mediocrity reached a peak at the April 2020 strategy meeting. There, GameStop management outlined a plan to “optimize the core” and “become the social / cultural hub for gaming” through building “experiential labs.” In other words, they wanted to drive more in-store traffic. During a pandemic year. (How on earth did management earn $35 million between them?)  Change Afoot? Redditors Think So.  All that began to change in August 2020, when Chewy founder Ryan Cohen bought 9 million shares of the retailer. He and two associates would later join the board in January 2021. “GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences — not remain a video game retailer that over-prioritizes its physical presence and stumbles on the online ecosystem,” said Mr. Cohen in a public letter to the board. Investors were delighted, sending shares on an initial run from $4 to $40. Mr. Cohen wasn’t just talking about improving e-commerce (a strategy that might have worked 15 years ago). Instead, he spoke of fundamental changes to GameStop’s business that could create a new, revitalized player in the $180 billion gaming industry. Change, however, won’t come readily. And that’s where Reddit investors come in. To date, Mr. Cohen only owns 13% of the company. That’s not enough to dislodge GameStop’s existing board; as late as last year, the board fought off another activist investor with grand plans for change. To be clear, there’s nothing particularly nefarious about current CEO George Sherman or his team. (Redditors, please don’t send pizzas to his house at 1 a.m.) Managing a declining business is already hard during good times and nearly impossible during crises. But to become an agent of change, Mr. Cohen needs more than his vote in the video game retailer. He needs other investor support.  Reddit Investors, Unite!  To date, Reddit investors have driven up GME stock using a financial quirk known as delta-gamma hedging. It happens when many investors buy deeply out-of-the-money calls — the lottery tickets favored by the r/WallStreetBets crowd. And in one of Wall Street’s least-understood processes, as prices rise, market makers will buy more GME stock to hedge their positions. That creates a feedback loop that pushes prices even higher. But for GameStop to reach a $500 price (and stay there), Redditors will need more than Wall Street’s quirks. To do more, they will need the four tools of activist investors: invest, strategize, agitate and vote.  Activist Investing 101  There’s the obvious first step with activist investing: Investors need to buy GameStop shares and hold on. Options can make you fabulously wealthy, but only common stockholders can vote in shareholder meetings. Next, investors need to strategize what’s best for GameStop. Sucking the lifeblood out of a dying company can make shareholders some money, but it won’t turn GME into a $35 billion firm. Neither will trying to beat established players like Twitch or Valve at their own game. Instead, winning strategies will involve identifying technologies a decade out and investing before others do. (A virtual reality universe, anyone?) Third, shareholders need to make their voices heard — something Redditors seem pretty good at doing already. With a single well-crafted public letter to the board (plus some backroom dealing), Mr. Cohen managed to gain three board seats. Smaller investors might not have the same platform, but they can undoubtedly start pressuring GME’s board to move faster. And finally, shareholders need to vote. Most investors typically outsource voting to their brokerages, making annual meetings a rubber-stamp ordeal. But unless shareholders come to Mr. Cohen’s aid, change won’t come fast enough.  Time Is Running Out for GME Stock  Reddit and Mr. Cohen will have to work fast. Thanks to their years of corporate debt binging, GameStop now sports a 3.5x debt-equity ratio. The retailer spends over $300 million in interest, upkeep and leasing costs, which will burn through its $446 million cash hoard faster than most people expect. Mr. Cohen has presumably seen the writing on the wall. Without drastic changes, GameStop’s chances will melt away faster than the ice cream cone that Mr. Cohen mysteriously posted on Twitter this week. That’s what makes CFO Jim Bell’s resignation on Wednesday so remarkable. Clearing the caretaker ranks is an essential first step to a turnaround, and Mr. Cohen seems to have pulled the board out of its slump. But more still has to happen. And Mr. Cohen needs your help, Reddit. For GameStop to reach $500, the firm would need a $35 billion market capitalization, or more than the value of Twitch and Steam combined. A secondary offering at $150 per share would be a start. A roughly 10% dilution would raise $1 billion, something AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) did during its January stock run-up. But money alone won’t solve GameStop’s decline. The firm desperately needs a new vision among its management ranks. Re-hiring a COO would be a good first step — the firm hasn’t bothered with one since 2019. Charting a long-term strategy (and finding the right person for the job) would be even better. In short, GameStop needs a strategy shift that should make even Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) co-founder Reed Hastings nod in approval. Mr. Cohen has worked his magic on Chewy.com before. And maybe he’s even the right person to take the top job at GameStop. But before he can start down that route, the 35-year-old founder will need all the help he can get. And with a Reddit-fueled megaphone, retail investors finally have the chance to make that happen. Good luck, Redditors. I’ll see you guys on the moon.

They're all fucked cause we're in this bitch. AND WE AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.    BUY & HOLD FELLOW RETARDS 💎✊🚀🚀    Grocery Outlet is a boomer bet with overtones of possible insane growth.                            First, the bedrock boomer shit. Grocery outlet buys strategically so they can offer products for 50% to 70% cheaper than the competition., Essentially, they allow my broke ass to eat organic ribeye every night if i so choose.   GO has just 375 locations in 6 states.   Their most recent 10k was released in 2019 and stated they have a longterm potential of 4,800 locations nationwide. GO is just getting started.  Their longterm growth is projected as 14.7% as compared to industries 12.4% in 2019.   They plan to expand their number of locations by at least 10% a year. This alone gets my dong hard.  As stated in their 10k, their management is not accustomed to operating a publicly owned business. This sounds bad, but is actually a good thing imo. GO is already an amazing business model. Imagine if an Ackman/R. Cohen type character came in and bought a huge chunk or the company installed a few heavy hitters to help scale the business.In fact,last week they added Maria Fernanda Meija(former VP Kellogg's) and Gail Moody-byrd(AI marketing analytics at noodle.ai)  to the board.           The above would be enough to get me to invest if i were a boomer, but as a WSB mutant, I need a possibility of a tendie volcano. Now for storytime.  HOW GROCERY OUTLET OFFERS DEEP DISCOUNTS If a store overstocks, a truck gets misdirected, packaging changes, production changes, or any such interruption in the ""Chain of freshness"" occurs, GO capitalizes on this while saving the other company from taking losses.        THE CHAIN OF FRESHNESS  You may have heard that up to a third of all food produced by Americans is thrown away. https: www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/491513/  The Chain of Freshness describes how this happens and how food MOVES. 1. Food is grown  2. Food sent to be processed and/or packaged/branded. 3. It goes to warehouse(this  sometimes involves many layers of regional and local warehouses.) 4. It goes to a store 5.You buy it.  Anywhere during this chain, product can get slowed down. It wont be fresh enough to  be accepted at the next checkpoint in the Chain, so it goes into a dumpster. Although the ""actual freshness"" of the product may be fresher than you would ever see at a store, its not fresh enough to  go to regional, then local distributors before landing at the store not only fresh enough to consume, but fresh enough to be able to sit on the shelf for however long is required by the stores business plan.   This would be a good time to state that im technically an ""industry insider"" as ive been dumpster diving for years. Ive seen warehouse dumpsters full to the top with product all packaged and nice, fresher than you would ever see at a store. You may have heard in the news recently about portland police guarding dumpsters full of food from citizens. Fred Meyer said the food was spoiled, but it was just unsellable due to liability issues and food quality laws. Perfectly edible food. https: apnews.com/article/portland-storms-oregon-4eebd2cd2f1b9f798667994bc871a647  This is just the tip of the iceberg, as warehouse dumpsters are usually behind fences and guarded with cameras so no one sees that waste, except for me. I fill my backpack with organic chocolate, hipflasks of brandy, and have personally recovered enough frozen marinated ribs to grill up and play Meat Jenga with(which we actually did.)  This waste is caused by logistics problems which could be alleviated by Grocery Outlet, adding value to everyone involved                   Now imagine this company if Food Waste Laws are passed, penalizing companies who waste food. With images of cops chasing people away from a dumpster full of perfectly good food in the news, the discussion is very likely to surface among other progressive talking points. Grocery Outlet is uniquely positioned to profit from this trend. If Companies were all of a sudden compelled to reduce their waste, it would be a huge growth opportunity. Just based on their current guidance GO is a great bet. But in this rapidly changing world, a newly public company like GO with an innovative business model can change its current guidance multiple times.  Tldr; a long standing glitch in the logistics of how we sell and move food around leads to dumpsters full of perfectly good food that makes up about a third of all the food Americans produce. GO has a unique business plan that, with the help of a big-dick activist investor,  hiring of corporate heavy hitters, and the Possibility of Food Waste Laws could turn those dumpsters full of food into dumpsters full of money for everyone involved.  Heres a link to an article that has the numbers I referenced. https: finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-grocery-outlet-144102370.html  Positions: All shares, about 10% of my investment capital. Long hold. I literally love the stock. I identify with grocery outlet on an emotional level. They allow me to buy all the fancy snacks I like and my loyalty to them is the closest ive come to  truly experiencing religion in my life."

Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc.

Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.

GAL,3,14837," So in essence SYNTHETIC SHORTING by the HEDGE FUNDS provide us with very powerful ROCKET FUEL that will take us not just to the moon but a whole other GALAXY.  Im buying more GME on Monday. Im just trying to figure out CALL strategy from here on out Stfu rly with 800 fucktards. 800 is srsly the fucking ezpz squeeze. Gamma squeeze will happen if we all just hold @ ezpz squeeze. And believe me gamma squeeze could go infinite. Set ur sell order at 69K or w/e. BE READY TO PUT UR MOONBOOTS ON CUZ GALAXIES ARS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"

BOILERPLATE: I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀  WARNING: BY THE END OF THIS POST YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS EUPHORIA OR PREMATURE 🚀 SYNDROME. THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF 'CONFIRMATION BIAS'. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE.  [Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)  \----------  Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https: www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https: www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https: www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.  \----------  For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:  ""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xw8lu1l122k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=644af631e8387d60cb475e33e67fcd1c66018b8d"
UVXY,3,-1, People really should be talking more about SQQQ or UVXY This comfirms my suspicion as well. I was telling this to my wife when the 1st collapse happened. Reason i noticed is because i had a UVXY position and it skyrocketed. 2nd time it went up again! >“Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing.” – Warren Buffett  I didn't know Buffett was also into loading the boat with UVXY calls.  Pretty gnarly
HAPP,3,28137," PUFFCO AND HAPPY CABBAGE DABS Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date! Hedge fund shills are spreading disinformation saying $800 is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.  It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.  DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN.  It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. IMAGINE IF YOU HAD SOLD EARLIER THIS WEEK AT $40!  WE CAN STAY RETARDED, LONGER THAN YOU CAN STAY SOLVENT!!"
PBR,3,15," Put it all in PBR! This post is the sharing of my due diligence for Petrobras (Ticker ""PBR"" AKA Pabst Blue Ribbon) after their most recent Q4 2020 results from Thursday, February 25, 2021.  Here are the important facts in my opinion:  1. Cash flow from operations during the three months ended 12/31/20 was $7.1 billion USD.  This represents 14% of their market capitalization during one quarter.  In Q1 2021, I expect it will be at least $10 billion, if not more.  That means if they took the cash on hand at 12/31/20 of $13 billion, plus their cash flows from operations during just the fiscal 2021 year, they could buy back more than 100% of their current market cap of common stock. 2. Their stock tends to move in conjunction with oil prices and also the BRL (local currency) compared to the US Dollar.  So when the US Dollar is weaker, the stock goes up.  Over the past 2 months the US Dollar has increased against the BRL by about 12%, pushing the PBR stock price down during that time. I believe with the US Stimulus about to pass, that this trend will reverse back significantly. 3. The recent news on Monday regarding the replacement of the current CEO of PBR with a retired general was due to complaints about Diesel fuel.  The stock dropped approximately 25% due to this news.  When you review the financials, you can see, in Q4 2020 that $3.7 billion of the $13.9 billion of revenues relates to Diesel fuel.  This is about 25% of the revenues of the Company.  However, the discounts that the government is asking PBR to make will not eliminate the revenue, it will potentially cause maybe a 10% reduction.  So this in effect is only a reduction of revenue by 2.5%.   Also, the board of directors has refused to allow this discount so far.  Therefore, I believe the 25% stock price decline is much steeper than the effect to the Company revenues of 2.5%. 4. The Tech industry is declining as interest rates rise.  Investors are in the process of moving into reopening stocks and commodity stocks in 2021.  Therefore, this is a tailwind for PBR; especially considering that Biden wants to shut down oil production in the USA which will further increase the price of oil and will not affect PBR in any way as Brazil doesn't restrict the oil exploration function in Brazil in the same way that Biden wants to in the USA.  So there will be no impairments on PBR's balance sheet like there will be on the USA companies should Biden decide to ban certain oil properties from permitting. 5. Technically, the stock found support on Monday, February 22, 2021 at $7.80 per share and bounced higher.  On Friday, February 26, 2021, the stock did not cross below $7.85, even when the market was moving lower; therefore there is strong support at this level.  My recommendation is first, to review the news and financials on the SEC website regarding PBR.  Then I recommend purchasing shares of the company under ticker PBR.  If you want to increase exposure, I also recommend purchasing long-dated call options at the $8, $9 and $10 levels for either January 2022 or January 2023.  https: preview.redd.it/i0ad4y48z1k61.jpg?width=725&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce4577a6750feb017a03ef1e558b1a626abdaa32 I thought a lot of this stuff about the craft brew alliance (BREW). Then they got bought by Budweiser. Nice. big gains.   Is PBR gonna get bought by Budweiser? I don't think so.   Do they make Rainier beer?   Yes. Buy PBR.

MSFT,3,221," Oi you fuckin worm, my first meme on this account was during the MSFT fiasco, and I used to have another account where I was shitposting back when apple hit 1T the first time. Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd. I don't know what that number puports to show but it is either an error or meaningless.  Trying pulling up the same information from that site for AAPL or MSFT and you will see mutual fund ownership above 1000%.      In short these numbers are wrong and should be disregarded. TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.  # Premise:  Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https: www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.  But let me try to explain nonetheless.  1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https: www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields. 2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https: www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher. 3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something. 4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https: www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https: www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)    1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.    2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https: www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.       1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on. 5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think). 6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently. 7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.    1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https: www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income. 8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.  # Conclusion  Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:  This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.  Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade, I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.  ^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to retards on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)  Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.  * Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening. * We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon. * Black swan events. * Think of something yourself man! This was a long ass post and I am getting late for finishing my day's work."
KNG,3,165," Great post!! THIS IS THE WAY!! HODL THE FCKNG LINE 🔥🔥🔥🚀🚀🚀🦍💪🏽 $FUBO is a sports based streaming service that's now rolling out their own sportsbook.  Stream the game - bet on the game - all in the same app.  ER is coming Tuesday of next week. They've raised guidance **TWICE** prior to this earnings report.  We just had the SuperBowl - and March Madness is almost here, the subs are going to be up so bigly over the last Q it will blow your wives boyfriend for her.  The growth potential of FUBO is massive, its another changing of the tides moment where Americans are ditching cable TV providers in favor of streaming services. Think **NFLX**, **ROKU**, etc.. they've all replaced their archaic counterparts. **This is just the streaming end of the business.**  Now factor in the sports betting aspect ( **DKNG**, **PENN**, etc ) and the added value of doing all of this from the same fucking app. Sports betting is slowly rolling out across the entire country.   Its a perfect storm of fundamentals that support the bull case for FUBO.   &#x200B;  FUBO's current subscriber base is **500k paid subs**, but check this out:  >""About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.""  Thats approx. 220 MILLION sports fans in the us and 190 MILLION who have gambled in the past year.  Lets throw some modesty in here and say FUBO could capture **5%** of this market, aka **\~ 10 MILLION**  **20x their current subscriber base.** 20. Fucking. Times.  Thats if they capture 5% of the market which is pretty fucking reasonable considering there is very limited competition on the sports streaming side of things.  &#x200B;  Alright now let me really fuck you up....  &#x200B;  Lets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:  FUBO MARKET CAP: **$3.5 billion**  * NFLX - **$240 billion** * ROKU - **$50 billion** * DKNG - **$25 billion** * PENN - **$18 billion**  I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..  **FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR**  &#x200B;  There is also the potential for a short squeeze. I know u retards love short squeezes.  * **53mm float** * **28 % short** * **Assuming an average \~ $40 entry for shorts**  &#x200B;  Fubo squeezed during the geemmmeee saga and is now associated with the meme stocks, FUBO is not a fuckin meme, its a motherfucker of a growth stock that has now turned into a powder keg. The ""squeeze"" would be backed by fundamentals, and sustained.   &#x200B;  **TLDR:**  **$FUBO TO $200** >ets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:   >   >FUBO MARKET CAP: $3.5 billion   >   >NFLX - $240 billionROKU - $50 billionDKNG - $25 billionPENN - $18 billion   >   >I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..   >   >FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR  FearlessTrader is sweating :)"
HAP,3,28137," PUFFCO AND HAPPY CABBAGE DABS Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date! Hedge fund shills are spreading disinformation saying $800 is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.  It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.  DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN.  It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. IMAGINE IF YOU HAD SOLD EARLIER THIS WEEK AT $40!  WE CAN STAY RETARDED, LONGER THAN YOU CAN STAY SOLVENT!!"
UPV,2,5, How can I infinitely UPVOTE THIS!! #LETS MAKE THIS THE MOST AWARDED AND UPVOTED REDDIT POST EVER

SNA,2,89," NOPE OTC is NOT FOR WSB !!! IT'S CALLED RESPECTING THE MODS.  ALSO,  I LIKE TROLL AUTIST  🦍 APE JESUS HAD 12 followers, 🐍 SNAKE HITLER HAD MILLIONS [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.

Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.

GLO,2,6," Why would anyone sell at $15-20? As the pandemic lessens and AMC opens up more and more GLOBALLY, not just in the US, this stock will easily rebound to $25 and pre-COVID levels by summer I think...assuming no squeeze or buyout. With all of the pent up demand, even if you take the short squeeze or Amazon out of the picture, I don’t think it would be unreasonable to see AMC hit all time highs or $40 range by EOY. My prediction is we will see some type of squeeze or a buyout in the next few months though. Definitely holding until something big happens. HOLD BATTLE BRUTHAS!! FOR THE GLORY OF THE IMPERIUM!!!"

PTON,2,791," Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰  Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:  When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.  RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself).   $RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back.   It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT.   BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?  GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you.   The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.  Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November.   Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.  BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:  Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?    TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌   Edit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40. To those who have family members who are special needs, I apologize - I am merely speaking the language of my targeted audience (WSB)  Positions: https: imgur.com/a/DbOCCYG (PTON is another story for another time) **NOTE:** I also have another 60k of RKT in my Roth.

UNL,2,6," TIME TO UNLOAD AMC AND REFILL GME LADS! As expected of a 1mon old account, this is complete bs. Sorry to pop your bubble, but it is EXTREMELY UNLIKELY that Melvin will run out of cash to leverage their shorts. You've seen yourself the manipulation; if they hedged every high and low they would never run out of capital, not to mention their sold calls that expired OTM. The squeeze will also never reach a point so as to bankrupt Melvin, because the SEC will step in to prevent a massive degrossings. Plus, Melvin rolled up their shorts to the hundreds, maybe even 400, so if you use the same ratio as before, GME would need to reach >5000$ to make them bankrupt. If it even gets close to that, we'll see the same closings of brokerages, media attacks, etc all enacted by the SEC."

NFLX,2,164," $FUBO is a sports based streaming service that's now rolling out their own sportsbook.  Stream the game - bet on the game - all in the same app.  ER is coming Tuesday of next week. They've raised guidance **TWICE** prior to this earnings report.  We just had the SuperBowl - and March Madness is almost here, the subs are going to be up so bigly over the last Q it will blow your wives boyfriend for her.  The growth potential of FUBO is massive, its another changing of the tides moment where Americans are ditching cable TV providers in favor of streaming services. Think **NFLX**, **ROKU**, etc.. they've all replaced their archaic counterparts. **This is just the streaming end of the business.**  Now factor in the sports betting aspect ( **DKNG**, **PENN**, etc ) and the added value of doing all of this from the same fucking app. Sports betting is slowly rolling out across the entire country.   Its a perfect storm of fundamentals that support the bull case for FUBO.   &#x200B;  FUBO's current subscriber base is **500k paid subs**, but check this out:  >""About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.""  Thats approx. 220 MILLION sports fans in the us and 190 MILLION who have gambled in the past year.  Lets throw some modesty in here and say FUBO could capture **5%** of this market, aka **\~ 10 MILLION**  **20x their current subscriber base.** 20. Fucking. Times.  Thats if they capture 5% of the market which is pretty fucking reasonable considering there is very limited competition on the sports streaming side of things.  &#x200B;  Alright now let me really fuck you up....  &#x200B;  Lets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:  FUBO MARKET CAP: **$3.5 billion**  * NFLX - **$240 billion** * ROKU - **$50 billion** * DKNG - **$25 billion** * PENN - **$18 billion**  I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..  **FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR**  &#x200B;  There is also the potential for a short squeeze. I know u retards love short squeezes.  * **53mm float** * **28 % short** * **Assuming an average \~ $40 entry for shorts**  &#x200B;  Fubo squeezed during the geemmmeee saga and is now associated with the meme stocks, FUBO is not a fuckin meme, its a motherfucker of a growth stock that has now turned into a powder keg.

MFG,2,252, OMFG is this real? Those guys belong here lol OMFG - I've actually seen this exact scene before . . . As it was originally intended to be aired lmao

AVY,2,878," The conditions have changed.     Originally the short positions were ALL under water. As the stock rose, say from $4 - $40, 140% of the float was short. If you were, for instance, 1,000,000 shares short at $4... You now were $40,000,000 upside down.      The HEAVY options activity back in January meant that call writers needed to hedge their risk as the price rose. There was one day it went from $20-$30 (50%) and then $30-$40. As that happened the likihood of those options expiring in the money became more realistic and the call writers needed to go get the shares in the case they had to deliver them to option owners. It literally was a BOMB waiting to explode.      Add in the WSB retail interest, the low float, and you had a catalyst for the stock to ONLY GO UP. Literally. An amazing historical moment in the history of finance.      After the wednesday when the price spiked from $60-$120 we saw a lot of profit taking and a lot of shorting at $120. This crashed the price to $60. This is the first moment that some new shorts entered at $120. Those positions were now healthy at $60.     Despite this, most shorts and most of the shorted float was still REALLY underwater big time. The big shorters were being margin called. As they were margin called they began selling blue-chips and their main holdings to get liquidity, this is why the market dipped big, and some shorters were margin called and liquidated- forced to close their positions.      So then the price went north of $120, now ALL shorters are under water again, and likely some started buying call options to hedge if this thing went up more. This actually exasperated the problem and made it more likely to go up due to call writers hedging.      So add in: 140% short float, margin calls, volatile stock, a lot of call options ITM, retail interest and WSB hype, PLUS big hedge funds were now entering the fun to make money on the squeeze.      POP... Price goes parabolic. Thursday night many shorts were looking at multi-billion dollar losses that they could not pay. The brokers would have had to pay those. So the brokers all decide to stop letting GME be bought. The shorters go to work Friday and sell, sell, sell... They drive the price down to $200 while opening new shorts at $450. Now a lot of shorts are in the green, but they haven't necessarily closed.   &#x200B;  Over the course of the next week people become despondent, fearful, and many sell. This gives shorts that opened at $450 downwards lots of liquidity to close shorts if they want, banking a killing. Those original shorts under $40 MAY have been closed as they were to average out with their other plays that worked. All in all most shorts are now hedged with long and short plays so nothing in particular can kill them. They are no longer cornered.      Since then the price has went UP and DOWN a lot. Every time it goes up it's a new opportunity for new short positions and new long positions. Every time it goes down it's an opportunity for shorts to close and bank profit and new longs to go in. The positions of every player now mean no one is overly compromised or stuck, there are just a lot of players involved with different profit targets. This means we shouldn't see any big margin calls or any forced covering of shares. These guys can wait it out, or they are hedging with their long calls if the price goes crazy stupid up. They are not idiots despite getting in this situation.      So while the GME price might be volatile and it might even get back to $500 the underlying infinite squeeze is no longer possible.      The only real way that the average retail guy can make money now is by being smart with your price entry and your price exit. Have a price target. Do you want to make 10%, 20%, 50%? Have that in mind and start taking profits once you are ahead. All that capital you will make you can use on your next trade.      Good luck to everyone, but do not buy into this situation as the conditions being the same as before- they are SO different... G💎ME🖐🥜ST🐸P🍦🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕 exercised all 20 of my call options!!!!

RHI,2,5," Not going by marketbeat. I go by a combination of several sources (some paid some free) as of 02/12/21 (the Feb B NYSE short report published on 02/25/21), the short interest was 43.09 million shares.  Most sites get the float wrong. It's the 100mil original issue in the S-1 and 15 million extra converted as optional purchases by the underwriters(shown in later SEC filings by RHI) or 115mil total. True SI is about 37.5% Just did. ""up to $1B""  To summarize they have four different share classes (A,B,C,D). Class A (one vote/share) will receive the dividend, No Class B or Class C shares were offered initially. The Founder/Chairman Dan Gilbert apparently has a pretty high stake in Rock Holdings Inc (RHI) which owns the majority of the class D shares (10 votes/share), giving them 79% of the voting power in the company. At any time class D shares can be converted to Class B or Class C shares.  So pretty much much of the controlling interest is maintained by the RHI LLC as seen in the Rocket's [Prospectus](https: www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805284/000104746920004448/a2242208z424b4.htm) on pg20-22  Have spent a few hours reviewing this stuff, and like the companies values/stance/mission/vision. I feel like it's almost too good to be true because there's no such thing as a free lunch.   I.e. I still need to do more research."

WK,2,3," Sound advice. When you sell, you own nothing, you have no claim from that point on. When you hold, you at least still own something and you have a claim, what potential that yields is hard to say at times but it's more than nothing. Think of a store that has inventory sitting on the shelf for what is determined to suddenly be too long. Do they just toss it into the dumpster and take a total loss? They shouldn't, someone would pay something for it. So selling at a loss is certainly better than a total loss, but in the world of stonks how would they go into the dumpster? If they do, the least of your worries should be about losing all your money but instead how did you convince yourself to buy in the first place. But what factor does this point have which changes things? Time. This is why suddenly a store decides, shelf space could be better used, space (volume) and time. They think a different product on the shelf will perform better with the shelf space over the same or less amount of time. But what if they could simply take a loss on a little of the shitty product and use the remaining shelf space towards a little of the new product? Space and time equilibrium. You don't have to dump everything if you only need a little space with the same amount of time to make up. Time is everything because you're dying and only have so much left but volume is important too.     From a hypothetical point, I would expect something like GME to spike about every month. Why? People get paid, monthly debts are settled. Now, I can't say for sure that GME will trend like most stocks where the highs just diminish over time, but people are losing on it, no doubt about that, each and every time that happens it removes potential capital which could go into that stock in the next buy frenzy. Then there's the subjective aspect, people don't like the unpredictable when it starts to really hurt, so they avoid, at the same time people inherently understand, nothing lasts forever, so they avoid. Either way, the spikes get smaller and smaller each month.     The last spike only produced about 280% compared to the \~2100% in Jan. I can capture that in 56 days of regular trading with a lot less risk. True I might be able to shave off a lot of time IF I max out the margin on GME and IF I was right about it and with much less equity. OR, I could just continue at 5% daily gains which I get. Something I see people not considering is a fixed amount they need by the end of the \~250 trading days, a real amount. I know what I want to make and only make in that year. Getting to the moon is not priority, priority is a real number I'm going to put on my returns every year. Everything changes once that is factored in. The way I look at charts, I'm not just interested in how deep or how high, I'm really interested in what is the absolute longest time in a dip, what is the average time in a gain. And if I can't determine that because there is so much noise, it's excluded. There's volatility which I like, I actually need to meet that daily average and then there's just pure chaos. That determines what I do with that stock. So far, since the early 90's, I've been doing well, very well considering and I started as simply selecting with what was essentially someone else's money because I was too young. I've known success, $100K (which started as $10K) in Apple in 2006 because someone bought me an iPod for my birthday, something I knew absolutely nothing about and it encouraged me to research. But I really like pattern trading. So in college I started.     With GME I would do this, wait until the third week of the month, buy with a limit that I think would give me a 20% gain and that's it, then back to sanity, if the limit fails to execute, I didn't want it anyways so don't care. Yeah, it really only would give me 4 days of trading that I can completely fuck up on, but that's 4 days, I'll take it. Don't get greedy, that's what fucks people, they get greedy and the best way to let greed destroy your returns is not determining what you need to earn before you buy as opposed to what you want to earn. Well fuck, I want ACMR to trade at Tesla prices, ok, that's not going to happen by then end of the year. There's absolutely nothing out there to suggest this (unless someone out here knows something I don't) LOL     Know how much you need at the end of a day, a month, a quarter and a year and use that to determine whether you stay in or out after you've already determined that the stock is reliable which is why you shouldn't have to worry about selling. IF at the end of a years trading you have more than expected, then you can dump it on shit like GME, it's bonus money if you want to see it that way because it was unexpected, but when you come up short the next year suddenly that money won't be looked at as a bonus anymore. If you are never able to view additional earnings as a bonus (which you won't be able to if you didn't establish a necessary end amount to begin with), stay away from things that are unpredictable, that the universe says, this would be a complete anomaly and is unnatural and you will never have to sell at a loss because it will never stay as a permanent loss.     That being said....I have about $85K tied up into complete bullshit stocks right now....just waiting and no, I will never, ever sell until they at least start to break even several times and I've found something which will produce as well or better. I'm stubborn that way but that's the bonus money I really don't give a shit about. My seed has been out for about a month because I saw this coming. Some would say, no, this is the time to buy everything, no it's not because I haven't seen even a -4 on the Great Oscillator which is to be obeyed, period. We're getting there though. So instead of putting yourself in a position of not selling, try putting yourself in a position of not buying in the first place. Stop caring about missing opportunities that are only regretful with hindsight and start realizing dips are forever, they're infinite and you only need a few every now and then. Different ways of looking at things. I would rather miss a golden opportunity than to be denied the ability to trade when I want even if that meant I have puny returns in comparison. Reliability first and foremost, then Hail Mary's and if you can never part with your earnings, that's ok too.     As for sticking it to the man, I remember watching the floor getting cleaned up on Wednesdays on the boob tube and the movies sucked me in when I was a kid. Hedges et al will always be around, they will survive, it's all they do, I don't care if they get wealthier, I care about me getting wealthier cause I know way, way too many people rely on those guys....they're fucking impervious. But I sort of want them that way, I need more money in the market, last thing I want to do is reduce it, that would be like hoping everyone gets fucked so I can pick up stocks at the lowest prices in history because nobody has any money to buy them so they're worthless. Why the fuck would I want that? I say manipulate all you want, retail, hedge, who cares because at the end of the day, if you can't read the fine lines in the bullshit, you shouldn't be trading. That being said, let's all watch WKHS either destroy Wood or turn her into an oracle, like there hasn't been hundreds of those before right? Like they lose one contract and suddenly they might as well have never produced anything to this point!? So stupid. Never sell at a loss, k, never buy at a loss, never sell at a gain, never buy at a gain or DD and you don't have to worry about nevers. Big difference between a ""loss"" perceived and a loss achieved; sense of time, patience and calm and knowing where you wanted to be in the first place and did you have a plan and how much error is acceptable in the plan. That's as good as it gets. Now get out there you retards and start buying the shit out of ACMR...kidding, don't I need the price to be logical. LMAO Hey, if NKLA could pull something out of their ass to beat the earnings estimate and then spew some nonsense that makes it sound like they have an actual path forward towards increased profitability, WKHS can too.   Of course no one believed NKLA’s bullshit..."

PBA,2,5," Fun fact: Pete is actually a very quiet guy when the cameras are off, shy almost. Close family member of mine knows him well and I’ve bowled w/ him before during a charity ProAm.  Other PBA guys I’ve bowled with are very talkative and joke and screw around during casual games. Pete is nice and gives you fist pounds for good shots but is quiet otherwise. He bowls just as serious as he does during PBA tournaments, just without the smack talking and theatrics. That is all for TV and his “brand”.  If a fan approaches him though - which during the event was often - he will take time out to shake their hand, say hi, give autographs and pose for pics but not something he particularly enjoys. He’s really short and tiny too.  Fam member said when he used to be on booze and coke years ago, he was the life of the party but since rehab he’s mellowed out quite a bit lol This is Pete Weber and he was a character. He won tournaments black out drunk and was kicked out of the PBA because drug issues. He's a fucking legend."

XRT,2,2887," Check out how long market makers have to cover shorts and the borrows of the XRT etf. 4 index options closure convergence as well. BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon.  HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK."
REI,2,5," If I had to add one more, it is allocate 25% to income generating investments like REITs, Communications (T,VZ) or MLPs Someone slap my monkey brain if I didn't get this right...but this is what I'm anticipating.  1. Special dividend. That's the first kick in the face for the shorts.  2. Special dividend at a crazy high price of $1.11 per share where the majority of shares are held by RKT insiders + retail investors like me + (here's the ""if"" part) if all of us being bullish on that and REINVESTING dividends = buying up more of the float. That's the first kick in the face  3. IF the CEO is really just loading up a big middle finger on the shorts, which it kind of looks like it, then he initiates the $1B buybacks at the same time the dividend pays out (March 23rd). A third kick in the face for the shorts.  Isn't that potentially the most brutal attack on shorts ever? So what is the play? I'm pondering an April 1st, 2021 call (after the dividend) for $21 and adding to my leaps that go out a year or two (not sure on the amount).  Are there any gaps in my understanding, idea, etc? Do those calls make sense for time and price?  Maybe I should just keep buying the stock instead. The short term options seem pretty attractive...lol"

(I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS."" I'll be reporting back when our tenddietown rocket launches past the moon.  HOLD THE LINE APES, I LIKE THE STOCK."
KIN,2,19," Why would DFV buy 50k more shares if he also didn't think it would moon? He could've cashed out and been set for life, never logged on to reddit ever again, and invested in nice dividend yielding etfs and lived like a KING. IF HES STILL IN, IM STILL IN! MOTHER FUCKIN WENDY'S"
EFF,2,8853," Honestly the feedback here is awesome and I am trying to respond to as many people as I can haha! Great way to spend Sunday before market opens and I double down on some shares and calls!  I am genuinely interested to hear from all the naysayers though who don’t believe in the stock and I’m going to make a post for discussion so we can all see where these people are coming from!  Also, thank you so much for the support on my most successful post so far! I am glad so many of you are reaching out to me to learn more about how I am approaching this and how it’s possible to jump on this ship without losing money!   Of course these are my opinions and I’m only saying what I would do/have done to keep me in the green even when the stock tanked last week by utilizing options and not setting the expiration for February 28th...  Anyways, my goal is to educate. If you have a differing opinion please explain it instead of tearing people down so we can all learn and grow together!  Maybe I am a little naive and innocent to believe we are here to support one another and that we all want to prosper together... Maybe. BUT that won’t stop me from trying!  Will I make a post like this again?  Yes.   What if you get hate?  I’ll STILL EFF’NG DO IT AGAIN  There’s more positivity here than hate.   Special Thank you to those of you also answering peoples questions about the stock and how to get in! This is why the stock will surge again! If we teach people how to invest more wisely it will reduce the need to paper hand for %20-%200 and cash out options at 500%-1000%+ so they can buy more shares!  Maybe some don’t want this. I dunno. But I want to find out so we move forward again!  Also, yes I own both GME and AMC in shares and options and my options are worth more than my shares for anyone wondering and I’m BUYING MORE tomorrow! Or Friday when it dips again   Why did I make this comment long?

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)  \----------  Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https: www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https: www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https: www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.  \----------  For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:  ""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xw8lu1l122k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=644af631e8387d60cb475e33e67fcd1c66018b8d"
DKNG,2,164," $FUBO is a sports based streaming service that's now rolling out their own sportsbook.  Stream the game - bet on the game - all in the same app.  ER is coming Tuesday of next week. They've raised guidance **TWICE** prior to this earnings report.  We just had the SuperBowl - and March Madness is almost here, the subs are going to be up so bigly over the last Q it will blow your wives boyfriend for her.  The growth potential of FUBO is massive, its another changing of the tides moment where Americans are ditching cable TV providers in favor of streaming services. Think **NFLX**, **ROKU**, etc.. they've all replaced their archaic counterparts. **This is just the streaming end of the business.**  Now factor in the sports betting aspect ( **DKNG**, **PENN**, etc ) and the added value of doing all of this from the same fucking app. Sports betting is slowly rolling out across the entire country.   Its a perfect storm of fundamentals that support the bull case for FUBO.   &#x200B;  FUBO's current subscriber base is **500k paid subs**, but check this out:  >""About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.""  Thats approx. 220 MILLION sports fans in the us and 190 MILLION who have gambled in the past year.  Lets throw some modesty in here and say FUBO could capture **5%** of this market, aka **\~ 10 MILLION**  **20x their current subscriber base.** 20. Fucking. Times.  Thats if they capture 5% of the market which is pretty fucking reasonable considering there is very limited competition on the sports streaming side of things.  &#x200B;  Alright now let me really fuck you up....  &#x200B;  Lets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:  FUBO MARKET CAP: **$3.5 billion**  * NFLX - **$240 billion** * ROKU - **$50 billion** * DKNG - **$25 billion** * PENN - **$18 billion**  I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..  **FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR**  &#x200B;  There is also the potential for a short squeeze. I know u retards love short squeezes.  * **53mm float** * **28 % short** * **Assuming an average \~ $40 entry for shorts**  &#x200B;  Fubo squeezed during the geemmmeee saga and is now associated with the meme stocks, FUBO is not a fuckin meme, its a motherfucker of a growth stock that has now turned into a powder keg. The ""squeeze"" would be backed by fundamentals, and sustained.   &#x200B;  **TLDR:**  **$FUBO TO $200** >ets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:   >   >FUBO MARKET CAP: $3.5 billion   >   >NFLX - $240 billionROKU - $50 billionDKNG - $25 billionPENN - $18 billion   >   >I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..   >   >FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR  FearlessTrader is sweating :)"

INFI,2,1686," GME to INFINITY and BEYOND!!! Hey folks! I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.  Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:  So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101). I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:     TL;DR: You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.    Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic. Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:  you start with ~0~ shares you borrow one from a broker you now have ~1~ shares you sell that share, completing your short you now have ~0~ shares  Now imagine the short squeeze happens. And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc. The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).  Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high: Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital.  You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.  you start with ~0~ shares you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker! you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!  Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with!  Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value:   THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?  Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy. Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.   If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations. Now think about that again.   Effective TL;DR 2.0:  People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule? Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.  But here’s MY question: What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it?  VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.   Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not. Joy to all, ~Unimportant   (this is not financial advise, and I am not a financial advisor)"
PPL,2,182," It is impossible to conclude from this post that the guy even lost money.  A margin call doesn't mean that you are negative.  It means that in order to maintain your current position, the broker requires a cash deposit.  As far as I can tell, this guy owns a shit ton of stock, and also has sold a huge # of options contracts.  The broker gives him credits for stocks he owns.  For instance, if he owns $100k of Apple, they might be willing to loan him $50k with those shares as collateral.  The broker subtracts credits for any options contracts he sells.  That's based on the estimated probability that those contracts expire in the money.  All this means is some combination of: (a) The broker's margin credit for some of his equities decreased.  For instance, if APPL becomes volatile, they might only be willing to loan him $15k for his $100k in collateral. (b) The broker's margin requirement for some of (short) options contracts decreased.  Now, it makes sense why he's pissed, especially if changed the requirements suddenly and then demanded $3M.  Brokers often use shitty systems to calculate requirements.  For instance, only in recent years could retail trading platforms correctly compute the margin requirements for call spreads (they would instead add the risk of the two contracts, as opposed to using them to offset each other).  Even these days, they are really bad at it. $APPL dropped like $3.50 in the last few minutes of trading on Friday..... with no news, no rumors, no discernible reason.  It just dumped out.  That's partly why it was trending."

IDU,2,96," [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates I think The stock split, HK listing, and eventual EV is a lethal combo but you’re right, that’s only IF we can breathe some life into tech this week  With JNJ announcement that’s tenuous, though, but I’ll probably be betting on BIDU all the way down Lolol"

Being more of a technicals guy WOOF's charts just look like an opportunity to me. I will definitely analyze Petsmart as well. A penny stock related to pet health (ZOM) recently popped, from 52wk low of .15 to over $2 after FDA approved some drug they developed. I suck at fundamental analyses but I do know enough to be bullish on pet stocks."

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)  \----------  Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https: www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https: www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https: www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.  \----------  For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:  ""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xw8lu1l122k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=644af631e8387d60cb475e33e67fcd1c66018b8d"
DNN,2,3," I made some money off DNN in the last uranium boom since then things have changed hands. Living in Moab it’s common knowledge about the uranium industry locally anyway. UUUU owns the only fully functional uranium mill in the US and the majority of the uranium mines in this area. If uranium prices go up they can be producing uranium ore within 30 days. Hope that helps The uranium run that happened was a p&d. There have been no catalysts, no big news, and the spot price hasn't gone up significantly yet. DNN doesn't even produce anything yet. I'm holding my shares until 2023."

That's about to change drastically. This morning, Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42.3%, said they repurchased $24.7 billion in shares in 2020, and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year ([2](https: www.berkshirehathaway.com/2020ar/linksannual20.html)). In addition, Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter. However, more important than any of these things (as significant as they are) is what was missing from the letter this year.  As many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years. He's complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term. In the meantime, he's fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines, banks, japanese conglomerates, etc. With this backdrop, remember that Buffett is not a boomer, he's from the Silent Generation. So, what he didn't say in the report is really important.   So what the fuck didn't he say? He didn't complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn't warn that BRK might lag SPY. You're not grasping the significance yet. Let me explain.  The reason he's been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants. In fact, he explains in his letter linked above that they're even better. He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them. Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner.  Over the next year, the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter. There's no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine.  Also, here's some simple math for you. SP500 P/E ratio: 38.8. BRK P/E ratio: 13.5. [Yes, I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK's P/E. That's because BRK's portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income.] This means BRK's underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion!  This is why Buffett didn't warn that BRK might underperform. He's back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY's ass again. Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK's multiple again.  Calls were cheap on Friday so I bought 170 BRK.B $242.50C 3/5/21. $50K YOLO on the Oracle of Omaha. Hopefully you will get a pop on Monday. We have stimulus passing the House so far, should start climbing again after that dip the last couple days. Bonds should be stabilizing soon.  Then BRK.B's great ER on top of that."
THRO,2,114," HE DEFECATED THROUGH A SUNROOF Courtesy of u/brawnerboy  I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https: www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)  If you haven't already, you should read it.  Linked here: [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).  This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.  To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.  This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.  TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.  The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.  Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90  &#x200B;  Edit: This is not financial advice I am retarded but I like this stock  Edit: As of 3:15 today the short interest has increased from 38% to 81%"

BOILERPLATE: I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀  WARNING: BY THE END OF THIS POST YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS EUPHORIA OR PREMATURE 🚀 SYNDROME. THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF 'CONFIRMATION BIAS'. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE.  [Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)  \----------  Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https: www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https: www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https: www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.  \----------  For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:  ""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xw8lu1l122k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=644af631e8387d60cb475e33e67fcd1c66018b8d"

GCP,2,17," This DD is misleading.  JFrog has a lot of competition and highly likely will get killed by the current way of publishing artifacts through containers and much more valued brands. AWS, Docker, GCP all have container repositories. Gitlab and Github other host artifacts.   They bought a weakass CI/CD solution to try to compete in a tough space with big players dominating the market like Github, Gitlab, CircleCI, they have zero chances of taking a big piece of the pie, they might upsell this feature along with dying artifactory if they're lucky.  The companies mentioned as customers, they might be using JFrog but for some fringe projects and most likely can be replaced in an instant, they will be using their own much better tech for the majority of projects.  Comparison with Atlassian(TEAM) and Crowdstrike(CRWD) is also wrong and misleading, they're both dominant forces in team collaboration and security respectively.  JFrog is a relic of the past addressing needs of the enterprise software, which soon might be if they're not already addressed but companies with much better dev tool suite in general and better following.  The valuation of already 5bln for this company I find laughable but those are the times.  TL;DR ANTI ROCKET SYSTEM  I've been a software engineer >10 years and I've never had a need for JFrog. Currently in dev tool space. It's not a winner. Stay away. I definitely want them to do well, but please don't just take my word for it.  They are a real company.  They have their own building in Silicon Valley and 8 offices around the world.    Google JFrog, Artifactory, BinTray, and read up.  You can go on the Azure, AWS, or GCP Marketplace and provision their product."

CPI,2,219," That's not how vaccination works, there's many cases of people getting covid multiple times, and vaccinated people getting the virus as well. It doesn't give you perfect immunity. Not to mention that the SA covid strain is very resistant to the current vaccine, and a booster is under development for that. With how slippery the virus is, there will be many strains that grow resistances toward vaccinations as we've already started to see.  There's an expected timeline for the South African strain coming to the US, I don't know what it is, but it will likely get here before the booster comes out. We'll see  The sentiment in the US and EU is a lot of negativity about the vaccine, and the magic number I've read was around 75% of people need to be vaccinated for herd immunity, which that 20% means nothing because vaccination isn't a linear model, there will be regression on the way to 75%.  Onto the economy, The US dollar is slipping, our GDP per debt dollar has fallen, the margin debt and options leverage has exceeded all historic data ever, poor people are poorer than ever, rich are richer than ever. This is mostly fine because as long as the CPI stays low people will be able to survive, when the CPI goes up (which may happen when a bunch of retards break the system) then there will literally have to be bread lines like 1929 or 1923 Germany.  Small businesses are starving out, surviving on bad loans from banks and the government. 1/5 of publicly traded companies are considered zombie companies surviving on the government's dime, but producing little to any GDP. The government has bought more junk bonds this year than ever before, most of which will end up defaulting. Commercial real estate and small business loans have been wrapped into CDO like products like in 2008, but are typically much safer thanks to the requirement for them to meet certain requirements. These business loans however are no longer AAA+ loans due to the economic downturn when they go tits up, one by one each traunch of these CDO-like products will fall one by one, like in 2008 (with less devastating effect).  Those are the reasons I'm still bearish on the market, the fact that Michael Burry has been saying mostly the same things makes me feel like I'm onto something, so I've received enough confirmation bias to stay with my short position.     Edit: had to make a correction for GDP per debt dollar, instead of incorrectly saying debt to GDP. TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.  # Premise:  Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https: www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.  But let me try to explain nonetheless.  1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https: www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields. 2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https: www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher. 3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something. 4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https: www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https: www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)    1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.    2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https: www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.       1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on. 5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think). 6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently. 7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.    1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https: www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income. 8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.  # Conclusion  Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:  This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.  Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade, I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.  ^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to retards on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)  Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.  * Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening. * We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon. * Black swan events. * Think of something yourself man! This was a long ass post and I am getting late for finishing my day's work."
SPXS,1,1, I believe you are looking for SPXS
EXCE,1,6, You are correct but it goes back even further. I remember last April it was a running fucking meme on here that every jobless claims day (Thursday morning for new initial claims numbers I think) stocks would rise EXCEPTIONALLY high Bc it would be like “1 million new claims vs 1.2 million expected!!!!”
AGG,1,14832," Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.

GES,1,2886," BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down. God, this is intimate. I feel like I’m financially inside of you or something. I'm jacked right, now. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS.""

Look for more sources, preferably for ones that published their article BEFORE the whole GME thing started. But most importantly, it you actually don’t understand it then DO NOT ENGAGE WITH IT.  Honestly, trading on margin/leverage without understanding the underlying risk is pretty stupid. You can amplify your losses by quite a lot (gains too, obviously).   https: www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012  https: www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-premium.asp  Blabla, obvious non financial advise, just advocating for looking up shit."

[Original Post](https: old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglap3/gme_power_to_the_people_who_played_themselves/) and [web archive](https: web.archive.org/web/20210227042334/https: old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglap3/gme_power_to_the_people_who_played_themselves/?sort=confidence)   Interestingly, that post had 0 karma (69% downvoted) and 160 comments. Exactly 4 out of the 160 comments agreed with me.    I still think GME is a terrible investment. Ryan Cohen’s last company CHWY [has yet to turn a profit.](https: www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/chwy/earnings). Maybe you apes are right and he’s a Business Jesus, but I invest based on numbers not on personality cults, and I haven’t seen any impressive numbers yet that would convince me to buy and hold GME. I do see numbers now and then (like IV%) that convince me to trade short-term--so I still hope it hits $500, I just don’t think it will. My long-term price target is between $2 and $36. I’ll adjust that at the next earnings report (and you should adjust your targets then too).   #Results   Calling all apes who made the bet! There aren’t any trading days left in February.

UFS,1,2," I think you're right, it could have been louder. According to the loudness meter I use this mix has a true peak of around -2.5db, and loudness of -15.5 integrated LUFS. I usually aim for a true peak of between -1db to -2db and loudness of -14LUFS when mastering since that's what most streaming platforms are optimized for, but in this case since I'd been doing virtually nothing but this for like 48hrs and just wanted to sleep I skipped the mastering step entirely and eyeballed the peak level instead 🤤"

ESG,1,91," [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates"

ROK,1,160," $FUBO is a sports based streaming service that's now rolling out their own sportsbook.  Stream the game - bet on the game - all in the same app.  ER is coming Tuesday of next week. They've raised guidance **TWICE** prior to this earnings report.  We just had the SuperBowl - and March Madness is almost here, the subs are going to be up so bigly over the last Q it will blow your wives boyfriend for her.  The growth potential of FUBO is massive, its another changing of the tides moment where Americans are ditching cable TV providers in favor of streaming services. Think **NFLX**, **ROKU**, etc.. they've all replaced their archaic counterparts. **This is just the streaming end of the business.**  Now factor in the sports betting aspect ( **DKNG**, **PENN**, etc ) and the added value of doing all of this from the same fucking app. Sports betting is slowly rolling out across the entire country.   Its a perfect storm of fundamentals that support the bull case for FUBO.   &#x200B;  FUBO's current subscriber base is **500k paid subs**, but check this out:  >""About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.""  Thats approx. 220 MILLION sports fans in the us and 190 MILLION who have gambled in the past year.  Lets throw some modesty in here and say FUBO could capture **5%** of this market, aka **\~ 10 MILLION**  **20x their current subscriber base.** 20. Fucking. Times.  Thats if they capture 5% of the market which is pretty fucking reasonable considering there is very limited competition on the sports streaming side of things.  &#x200B;  Alright now let me really fuck you up....  &#x200B;  Lets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:  FUBO MARKET CAP: **$3.5 billion**  * NFLX - **$240 billion** * ROKU - **$50 billion** * DKNG - **$25 billion** * PENN - **$18 billion**  I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..  **FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR**  &#x200B;  There is also the potential for a short squeeze. I know u retards love short squeezes.  * **53mm float** * **28 % short** * **Assuming an average \~ $40 entry for shorts**  &#x200B;  Fubo squeezed during the geemmmeee saga and is now associated with the meme stocks, FUBO is not a fuckin meme, its a motherfucker of a growth stock that has now turned into a powder keg. The ""squeeze"" would be backed by fundamentals, and sustained.   &#x200B;  **TLDR:**  **$FUBO TO $200**"

FORW,1,14832," Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date.

This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight.

LMT,1,1, Quick question: (I haven’t placed it) but “buy +1 GME 100 16 April ‘21 0.5 @1.00 LMT [to open]” means I’m betting the stock dropped below $100 before then correct? And it says “break even stock price 1.50” <- what does that mean too
EXPL,1,83322, THE ECONOMY EXPLAINED
ECOS,1,337," In **RKT DD Part I**, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. **Refer to RKT DD Part I Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)  In **RKT DD Part II** I discuss Rocket’s infectious culture from an employee’s (my own) perspective and why it will allow them to be the Amazon on Fintech. **Refer to RKT DD Part II Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt\_dd\_part\_ii\_a\_former\_employees\_take\_on\_rockets/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt_dd_part_ii_a_former_employees_take_on_rockets/)     **RKT DD PART III:**  Now I want to address you dumbasses who lump Rocket in with United Wholesale Mortgage Company and Loan Depot.  *LoOk HoW LoAn DePoT aNd UwMc ArE DoInG – MoRtGaGe CoMpAnIeS SuCk*  Listen you simpletons, Rocket Companies OWNS THE ENTIRE HOUSING ECOSYSTEM:  * From the Front end with their **Rocket Homes** business (Zillow, Redfin competitor) * To the origination of the loan via **Rocket Mortgage** (whether direct to consumer or through their broker channel) * To their **Amrock** title insurance business which orders the appraisals and title insurance * To their **Nexsys Solutions** with tools that allow for Remote Online Notarization, enabling the mortgage process to be 100% digital * And with their **servicing business** which allows them to think about their clients on a lifetime perspective rather than on just a transactional level.  As they continue to grow their entire housing ecosystem, they are also leveraging their tech platform for other ancillary businesses such as Rocket Loans and Rocket Auto.  Link to all of Rocket’s companies below:  [https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/](https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/)  **Let’s talk Rocket Auto:**  Investors mistakenly think that Rocket Auto hasn’t launched Yet. It’s true Rocket Auto hasn’t launched *publicly* but it doesn’t mean Rocket Auto hasn’t launched. **Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales, marketing and customer service.** Rocket even powers their e-commerce platform. They literally run every part of Vroom’s business except for the delivery of the vehicle.  If you look at VROOM’s 10Q, you’ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4-year agreement with VRM. The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8,641,914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four-year period, in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket’s e-commerce platform. That’s $430M worth of shares. Let’s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom (2015) so we don’t even know how much he already owns. See section of Vroom’s 10Q below:  *Paragraph in VRM 10Q: “On May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Rocket”) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the “Rocket Auto” brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the “RA Agreement”). The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform, but all sales of the Company’s inventory will be conducted through the Company’s platform.* ***Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2021*** *and, during the term of the RA Agreement, Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory. The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company’s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement.* ***The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period*** *based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.”*  As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter…and **what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday’s earnings report?** A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don’t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted.  I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom – why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn’t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it’s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly.  **Why is used car sales good for Rocket?**  Because Data, Data, Data.  Rocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans  Rocket can very easily have access to half of America’s homeowners credit reports by 2030 – The jackpot of consumer data.  What does a credit report tell you? **It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off.** This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform.  Look at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana’s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket’s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket’s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus – to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world’s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate.  Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes **1 million decisions per day** and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions.  Not to mention, ***Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales***\*\*.\*\* We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep – and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana’s presence.  **Rocket Homes:**  *WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW:*  Dear smooth brain, please download “Rocket Homes” on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow.  I’ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won’t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes.  I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket’s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial).  Not going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B – A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET’s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED.  **Rocket’s expansion internationally:**  Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B.  We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country.  Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket’s Lendesk fits the Bill.  Unfortunately these dumbass mods won’t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/) Link below:  [https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  This international expansion (along with Rocket’s other ancillary businesses) highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started.  **Short Squeeze**  Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares – but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares.  Despite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market.  To combat this unnecessary shorting, **Rocket announced a $1B buyback**; currently their float is $2B.  First off, who even announces a buyback when they’ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of.  Rocket’s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday’s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover?  Initially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn’t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn’t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August – that’s how much he believes in this company.  Gilbert has a big ego – so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron’s Fathead to Benedict Arnold’s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America’s biggest traitor*. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below:  [https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/](https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/)  This was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect.  Just like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I’m sure he’s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close).  Fun fact – even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James’ departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship… Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000](https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000)  **But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren’t they buying back shares at these these levels?**  Answer: because they likely can’t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain.  According to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading.  What is material information? Material information is any information that hasn’t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released.  What is Rocket's ""non-public material information"":  * The announcement of Rocket’s big, new financial partner * The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto  This information is likely to be made public on Thursday’s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float. And to put fuel on the fire, Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back, that is, if there are any shares left for purchase.  Gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs, imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into.  Say it with me now: Rocket Bears are Fucked.  TDLR: this doesn’t contain even a fraction of the information in this DD part three (or DD part one and two) but this dude does a good job summarizing RKT’s situation.

DAX,1,455," Very long post summarising hundreds of years worth of short squeezes.  Edited for formatting.  Positions: GME 65 shares @ $105.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/eddie-gilbert-the-boy-wonder-of-wall-street#:~:text=On%20June%2012%2C%201958%2C%20the,remaining%2050%25%20of%20Bruce%20stock.  Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.  The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis  Saunders vs. the Shorts Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.   The Shorts Are Cornered Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.   Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.   https: www.americanheritage.com/jacob-schiff-and-northern-pacific-corner#2  In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.  Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.  On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.  Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.  By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.  Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.  The New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.  https: www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26 https: www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.  Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.  At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.  VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.  The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.  In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.  “The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.  “In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”  Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.  Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.  “We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”  Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.  It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”  Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.  The “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.  Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.  “Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.  Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.  Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.  VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING? Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.  This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.  Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.  “The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.  Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.  But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.  When asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”  The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.  https: www.marketwatch.com/story/squeeze-on-goldman-put-falcone-in-penalty-box-2013-08-21  Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.  He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.  In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.  Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.  It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.  As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.  In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.  Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.  Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)  This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.  That’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.  Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.  The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.  “Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.  I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.  “Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.  https: moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/  [Removed to keep within character limit]  https: nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/  After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.  The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.  But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.  Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.  The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.  Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.  “There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.  Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.  Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”  Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.  Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.  “Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.  Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.  But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.  “We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.  Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.  Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.  Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.  Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.  https: medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d  The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.  At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.  With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.  Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.  Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda: “Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.” This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.  Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.  Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.  Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned. Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.  Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.  From The Great Game:  “Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”  Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”  Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”  Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.  “The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‘short of Harlem’, meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’”"

CFA,1,-6," ￼≡  Redditors, Ryan Cohen Needs Your Help to Send GME Stock Back to $500  2/26/2021 1:32pm EST  By Thomas Yeung, CFA, InvestorPlace Markets Analyst  In 2015, the Financial Times joked that RadioShack, an ailing brick-and-mortar electronics chain, should consider selling fruit baskets or turning its stores into Zumba studios to survive. The retailer had ignored the threat of e-commerce for so long that few believed it could survive. Two years later, RadioShack was virtually no more.  ￼￼  Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com  Today, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock sits at a similar juncture. Since the early 2010s, GME’s top brass had treated the retailer like drunks at an open bar — doling out a princely dividend to shareholders (and stock options to themselves) while cutting reinvestment into aging stores. But then something happened: A group of retail investors, driven by Reddit’s hedge-fund-hatin’ r/WallStreetBets decided to take GME stock from $10 to $480 in a matter of weeks. The people still love GameStop! This love for GameStop and disdain for Wall Street is an unusual combo. It means that, unlike RadioShack in 2015, the video game retailer still has a fighting chance. For the good of GameStop and its shareholders, Reddit investors need to finish the revolution they started. And if they do, Redditors and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) founder Ryan Cohen can still send GME stock back to $500.  GME Stock: Intentionally Driven into a Ditch  Anyone who’s recently visited a GameStop store will tell you the same thing: They look old. And that’s by design. For over a decade, GameStop’s management has enriched shareholders at the expense of the firm. GameStop’s capital expenditure, the budget used to maintain its stores, peaked in 2011 at almost $200 million before getting cut in favor of larger dividends and share buybacks. Meanwhile, the company’s stores have continued to age, and layoffs have continued unabated. Yet, shareholders allowed then-CEO J. Paul Raines to maintain the course. Why? It made them money. Customers, employees and other stakeholders weren’t a priority. And after several failed acquisitions, including game developer Kongregate, GameStop’s management decided that milking the company for cash was a better bet. The firm’s blind commitment to mediocrity reached a peak at the April 2020 strategy meeting. There, GameStop management outlined a plan to “optimize the core” and “become the social / cultural hub for gaming” through building “experiential labs.” In other words, they wanted to drive more in-store traffic. During a pandemic year. (How on earth did management earn $35 million between them?)  Change Afoot? Redditors Think So.  All that began to change in August 2020, when Chewy founder Ryan Cohen bought 9 million shares of the retailer. He and two associates would later join the board in January 2021. “GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences — not remain a video game retailer that over-prioritizes its physical presence and stumbles on the online ecosystem,” said Mr. Cohen in a public letter to the board. Investors were delighted, sending shares on an initial run from $4 to $40. Mr. Cohen wasn’t just talking about improving e-commerce (a strategy that might have worked 15 years ago). Instead, he spoke of fundamental changes to GameStop’s business that could create a new, revitalized player in the $180 billion gaming industry. Change, however, won’t come readily. And that’s where Reddit investors come in. To date, Mr. Cohen only owns 13% of the company. That’s not enough to dislodge GameStop’s existing board; as late as last year, the board fought off another activist investor with grand plans for change. To be clear, there’s nothing particularly nefarious about current CEO George Sherman or his team. (Redditors, please don’t send pizzas to his house at 1 a.m.) Managing a declining business is already hard during good times and nearly impossible during crises. But to become an agent of change, Mr. Cohen needs more than his vote in the video game retailer. He needs other investor support.  Reddit Investors, Unite!  To date, Reddit investors have driven up GME stock using a financial quirk known as delta-gamma hedging. It happens when many investors buy deeply out-of-the-money calls — the lottery tickets favored by the r/WallStreetBets crowd. And in one of Wall Street’s least-understood processes, as prices rise, market makers will buy more GME stock to hedge their positions. That creates a feedback loop that pushes prices even higher. But for GameStop to reach a $500 price (and stay there), Redditors will need more than Wall Street’s quirks. To do more, they will need the four tools of activist investors: invest, strategize, agitate and vote.  Activist Investing 101  There’s the obvious first step with activist investing: Investors need to buy GameStop shares and hold on. Options can make you fabulously wealthy, but only common stockholders can vote in shareholder meetings. Next, investors need to strategize what’s best for GameStop. Sucking the lifeblood out of a dying company can make shareholders some money, but it won’t turn GME into a $35 billion firm. Neither will trying to beat established players like Twitch or Valve at their own game. Instead, winning strategies will involve identifying technologies a decade out and investing before others do. (A virtual reality universe, anyone?) Third, shareholders need to make their voices heard — something Redditors seem pretty good at doing already. With a single well-crafted public letter to the board (plus some backroom dealing), Mr. Cohen managed to gain three board seats. Smaller investors might not have the same platform, but they can undoubtedly start pressuring GME’s board to move faster. And finally, shareholders need to vote. Most investors typically outsource voting to their brokerages, making annual meetings a rubber-stamp ordeal. But unless shareholders come to Mr. Cohen’s aid, change won’t come fast enough.  Time Is Running Out for GME Stock  Reddit and Mr. Cohen will have to work fast. Thanks to their years of corporate debt binging, GameStop now sports a 3.5x debt-equity ratio. The retailer spends over $300 million in interest, upkeep and leasing costs, which will burn through its $446 million cash hoard faster than most people expect. Mr. Cohen has presumably seen the writing on the wall. Without drastic changes, GameStop’s chances will melt away faster than the ice cream cone that Mr. Cohen mysteriously posted on Twitter this week. That’s what makes CFO Jim Bell’s resignation on Wednesday so remarkable. Clearing the caretaker ranks is an essential first step to a turnaround, and Mr. Cohen seems to have pulled the board out of its slump. But more still has to happen. And Mr. Cohen needs your help, Reddit. For GameStop to reach $500, the firm would need a $35 billion market capitalization, or more than the value of Twitch and Steam combined. A secondary offering at $150 per share would be a start. A roughly 10% dilution would raise $1 billion, something AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) did during its January stock run-up. But money alone won’t solve GameStop’s decline. The firm desperately needs a new vision among its management ranks. Re-hiring a COO would be a good first step — the firm hasn’t bothered with one since 2019. Charting a long-term strategy (and finding the right person for the job) would be even better. In short, GameStop needs a strategy shift that should make even Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) co-founder Reed Hastings nod in approval. Mr. Cohen has worked his magic on Chewy.com before. And maybe he’s even the right person to take the top job at GameStop. But before he can start down that route, the 35-year-old founder will need all the help he can get. And with a Reddit-fueled megaphone, retail investors finally have the chance to make that happen. Good luck, Redditors. I’ll see you guys on the moon.

PLTR already has a 30b market cap, any significant price movement in the stock would take significant volume and a big market cap bump. Where they are priced now not only seems fair but also seems to have a few years of growth priced in. IBM and ORACLE have multiples higher of revenue and both trade about 3x stock price"

GLD,1,4," Maybe a little bit of both honestly.... I think initially they were on the losing side big time and I’m almost 100% certain that they covered quite a bit when people were unable to purchase shares of conveniently restricted companies on many different platforms and market manipulation was rampant only allowing people to sell and not buy and raising margin requirements forcing positions to be closed and driving the price Down I saw a very similar thing happened in 2011 when Silver and Gold Hit all time highs and they raised margin requirements on SLV AND GLD many times over in order to suppress the price and force people to close positions and it worked That combined with the FEDS quantitative easing and buying mortgage backed securities to keep interest rates low and money cheap encouraging spending to give this false illusion that the economy is fine and running on all cylinders.... Anyway no one can know for certain if the hedge funds have been buying call positions to cover their shorts, I’m almost certain they are,.... however it might not just be the hedge funds that are shorting the stocks any longer I feel like a lot more retail investors also started shorting these stocks just as much as the people who are buying it and one thing is for certain stock can go infinitely higher but it only can go so low, plus with all the exposure all over the Internet and television/news outlets over the past 2 months talking about these meme stocks being a joke they might as well just be encouraging regular retail investors on TV to short these (MEME) companies and capitalize on the retail investor shorting this time while holding and adding to long positions themselves hence possibly screwing over the retail investor in the opposite direction this time.  Again this is all speculation but there’s a lot of short interest still in these stocks and it’s coming from somebody and we can capitalize on it again. I’ll be honest I really feel like a lot of these hedge funds probably closed ALOT BUT NOT ALL SHORT POSITIONS and covered their short positions when many of these brokerages were preventing people from buying and the price dropped like a rock it only makes sense it was a short window for them and I’m almost 100% sure they capitalized on it who is shorting the stocks right now?... Who knows but somebody is and there are a lot of them and when the stocks go up it’s a very bad time for them. Next week should be exciting"

VRM,1,337," In **RKT DD Part I**, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. **Refer to RKT DD Part I Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)  In **RKT DD Part II** I discuss Rocket’s infectious culture from an employee’s (my own) perspective and why it will allow them to be the Amazon on Fintech. **Refer to RKT DD Part II Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt\_dd\_part\_ii\_a\_former\_employees\_take\_on\_rockets/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt_dd_part_ii_a_former_employees_take_on_rockets/)     **RKT DD PART III:**  Now I want to address you dumbasses who lump Rocket in with United Wholesale Mortgage Company and Loan Depot.  *LoOk HoW LoAn DePoT aNd UwMc ArE DoInG – MoRtGaGe CoMpAnIeS SuCk*  Listen you simpletons, Rocket Companies OWNS THE ENTIRE HOUSING ECOSYSTEM:  * From the Front end with their **Rocket Homes** business (Zillow, Redfin competitor) * To the origination of the loan via **Rocket Mortgage** (whether direct to consumer or through their broker channel) * To their **Amrock** title insurance business which orders the appraisals and title insurance * To their **Nexsys Solutions** with tools that allow for Remote Online Notarization, enabling the mortgage process to be 100% digital * And with their **servicing business** which allows them to think about their clients on a lifetime perspective rather than on just a transactional level.  As they continue to grow their entire housing ecosystem, they are also leveraging their tech platform for other ancillary businesses such as Rocket Loans and Rocket Auto.  Link to all of Rocket’s companies below:  [https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/](https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/)  **Let’s talk Rocket Auto:**  Investors mistakenly think that Rocket Auto hasn’t launched Yet. It’s true Rocket Auto hasn’t launched *publicly* but it doesn’t mean Rocket Auto hasn’t launched. **Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales, marketing and customer service.** Rocket even powers their e-commerce platform. They literally run every part of Vroom’s business except for the delivery of the vehicle.  If you look at VROOM’s 10Q, you’ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4-year agreement with VRM. The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8,641,914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four-year period, in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket’s e-commerce platform. That’s $430M worth of shares. Let’s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom (2015) so we don’t even know how much he already owns. See section of Vroom’s 10Q below:  *Paragraph in VRM 10Q: “On May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Rocket”) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the “Rocket Auto” brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the “RA Agreement”). The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform, but all sales of the Company’s inventory will be conducted through the Company’s platform.* ***Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2021*** *and, during the term of the RA Agreement, Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory. The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company’s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement.* ***The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period*** *based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.”*  As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter…and **what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday’s earnings report?** A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don’t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted.  I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom – why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn’t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it’s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly.  **Why is used car sales good for Rocket?**  Because Data, Data, Data.  Rocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans  Rocket can very easily have access to half of America’s homeowners credit reports by 2030 – The jackpot of consumer data.  What does a credit report tell you? **It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off.** This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform.  Look at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana’s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket’s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket’s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus – to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world’s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate.  Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes **1 million decisions per day** and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions.  Not to mention, ***Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales***\*\*.\*\* We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep – and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana’s presence.  **Rocket Homes:**  *WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW:*  Dear smooth brain, please download “Rocket Homes” on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow.  I’ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won’t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes.  I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket’s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial).  Not going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B – A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET’s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED.  **Rocket’s expansion internationally:**  Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B.  We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country.  Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket’s Lendesk fits the Bill.  Unfortunately these dumbass mods won’t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/) Link below:  [https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  This international expansion (along with Rocket’s other ancillary businesses) highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started.  **Short Squeeze**  Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares – but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares.  Despite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market.  To combat this unnecessary shorting, **Rocket announced a $1B buyback**; currently their float is $2B.  First off, who even announces a buyback when they’ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of.  Rocket’s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday’s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover?  Initially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn’t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn’t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August – that’s how much he believes in this company.  Gilbert has a big ego – so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron’s Fathead to Benedict Arnold’s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America’s biggest traitor*. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below:  [https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/](https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/)  This was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect.  Just like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I’m sure he’s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close).  Fun fact – even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James’ departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship… Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000](https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000)  **But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren’t they buying back shares at these these levels?**  Answer: because they likely can’t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain.  According to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading.  What is material information? Material information is any information that hasn’t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released.  What is Rocket's ""non-public material information"":  * The announcement of Rocket’s big, new financial partner * The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto  This information is likely to be made public on Thursday’s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float. And to put fuel on the fire, Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back, that is, if there are any shares left for purchase.  Gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs, imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into.  Say it with me now: Rocket Bears are Fucked.  TDLR: this doesn’t contain even a fraction of the information in this DD part three (or DD part one and two) but this dude does a good job summarizing RKT’s situation.

INFU,1,31," They aren't running out of anything without buying pressure to fill FTDs. These guys have billions to play with and they are making money buying dips and selling options too. They are slowly covering because of limited supply. Once inflation heats up bond yields will shrink the market and suddenly their money pool will become less plentiful. That's when the squeeze will squozen in my retarded opinion.  Synthetic shares are infinite as long as the price points land perfectly. That's why price should be ignored because it's being manipulated to get tens of millions in calls and shorts. Also notice only losses are being advertised and not gains by the media. Why did they ""bail out"" Melvin? The inflation incoming will prove their short positions right before GME can change longterm. Just buy, hold, until the tendieman cometh.

Additionally, very few COMEX contracts are exercised for delivery, and if 100% of them were, there would be a short squeeze tomorrow because the paper contracts represent 100x of the physical that exists. There's going to be a giant correction eventually."
TSE,1,139," Alright, I know most of you can't read anything longer than a fortune cookie, so I'm putting this right up here at the top:  TL;DR -    1. GME market cap goes up   2. Index funds end up underweight GME   3. They must fix this before May/June, or losses are locked in   4. Tendies      So I was sucking on the Frosty machine at Wendy's when I decided to look into what it might mean for GME when it moves from the Russell 2000 (small cap) to the Russell 1000 (large cap) in May and June.  This typically doesn't mean much for a single stock, but with the volatility we've seen with GME already, as well as the percentage change in market cap, I think this may be more significant for GME than most companies.  FTSE Russell does a big giant rebanlacing that lasts about two months in May and June.  Link here for the 2020 schedule. [https: www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule](https: www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule) .  The 2021 dates aren't released yet but should be basically the same.  Because of the recent run-up in price on GME, it is set for a move from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000.  This same price increase also left many active fund managers underweight in GME, and they are losing out on recent gains.  All of this means Russell 2000 active fund managers who are underweight in GME right now, only have about 2-3 months to attempt to fix it before it gets taken out of the index, and their under performance on GME gets locked in.  It's quite possible that they are helping to form a large part of the floor, and their increasingly desperate attempts to not have the underweight GME locked in at re-balancing time will cause more and more volatility as the deadline approaches.   A recent comparison I would like to make is to TSLA, both because of its retail popularity, short interest, and volatility leading up to SP500 inclusion.  S&P announced that TSLA would be added to the index on Nov. 17, 2020, and it was officially added on Dec. 21. In that time, it's stock price went from $441 to $649, with an overall increase in market cap of over $200 billion dollars.  With a current market cap of around $5-10 Billion dollars depending on the day, it takes a lot less money to move the price on GME, and with the high likelihood of underweight Russell 2000 index funds, we may see even more volatility leading up May/June than we have so far this year.  &#x200B;  Disclosure - I am long GME.  This is not financial advice.  I used to work at Wendy's but was fired."

The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"
SMH,1,1, My thoughts exactly SMH
NGA,1,91," [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates"

Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys!

IOR,1,7," If he holds it until the expiration date, in this case 2/26 it would expire “out of the money” (not having made it to its target price, and would be worth zero.    Any time PRIOR to that, an option has some value, starting with the price paid at purchase (the “premium”) and then depending on the price movement  of the underlying stock, an option can increase or decrease in value.   So when $GeeMEee went up to $180, the option (with the stock now closer to, but not at $800) went up also.  Best suggestion is watch some YouTube videos that explain option price movement. They’re risky and the cost of education is expensive :)"
CRI,1,32," **First, I am not a financial analyst or am I here to advise on what to do, here to just share my personal insights for discussion/entertainment purposes only. I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%!

STLY,1,790," Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰  Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:  When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.  RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself).   $RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back.   It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT.   BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?  GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you.   The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.  Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November.   Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.

GAA,1,9," # 🐸 is getting ready to leap.  This is my first DD post so I would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions I am making here. But I thing that JFrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why.  # What do they do?  Their main product is JFrog Artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries (runnable code) and it also serves as a mirror repository - local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer JFrog X-Ray that scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities). This is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory, Artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator, with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock, with X-Ray it also helps to ensure food safety.  **You may have heard of the Solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack. In my professional opinion, the toolset JFrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security.** That is why I am very much a Bullfrog 🐂🐸. If there is interest, I will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one, this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very, very well going forward.  # Company background  They were founded in 2008 and there main product has been Artifactory ever since. It has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope, Sonatype Nexus, but Artifactory is better and cheaper. Sonatype started as a plugin for Artifactory that does something similar to X-Ray before X-Ray existed, then they copycatted the Universal Repo, so JFrog hit back with X-Ray. I have used both of these products over the years (since 2013) and I have worked in environments without, Artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company Intellectual Property.  Their product is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook. These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe**. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have over 90% renewal rate of their customers.  They acquired Shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory. Though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are Open Source.  Their focus lately has been on offering a SaaS model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier. This should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic.  They went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as Snowflake.  # Financials  I am including a couple of Comps here based on the segment they operate in. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software Team collaboration. I picked them as a comp because I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.  * As a high growth software company, unsurprisingly their GAAP earnings are negative. Surprisingly to me though, they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability.    * FROG: -$0.1861    * CRWD: -$0.4763    * TEAM: -$4.9355 * Their market cap    * FROG: $4.9 B    * CRWD: $47.8 B    * TEAM: $59.4 B * Their forward P/E Ratio    * FROG: 615    * CRWD: 771    * TEAM: 173 * They don’t have any long term debt * Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3 * Their margin is over 80% * Revenue is growing 44% YOY  # Ownership  65% owned by insiders and institutions  Most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Index Fund) that own it.  Their final lockup was just released on 2/16 after their earnings and insiders have through 3/13 to sell before they go back into lockup. This is similar to what happened with Palantir recently, but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell.  # TL;DR  They have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry. They are well managed and have good financials as well.  # Positions  420 shares and 61 options, I am planning to get 8 more options on Monday. If you haven't guessed yet, I like the stock. You can check my post history to see some YOLO posts from earlier this week. I will post another update when I am fully loaded with 420/69 to ride this 🚀  My EOY price target is at least $100/share from the current price which is at $53.49 on Friday.  # Fun Frog Fact  In 1992 Frogs were the first vertebrates to have sex in space.  &#x200B;  # Sources  The company's website  [https: jfrog.com](https: jfrog.com)  For research on financials I have used the Shwab's site, but you need to be a customer to access.

PSHG,1,455," Very long post summarising hundreds of years worth of short squeezes.  Edited for formatting.  Positions: GME 65 shares @ $105.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/eddie-gilbert-the-boy-wonder-of-wall-street#:~:text=On%20June%2012%2C%201958%2C%20the,remaining%2050%25%20of%20Bruce%20stock.  Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.  The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis  Saunders vs. the Shorts Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.   The Shorts Are Cornered Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.   Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.   https: www.americanheritage.com/jacob-schiff-and-northern-pacific-corner#2  In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.  Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.  On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.  Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.  By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.  Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.  The New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.  https: www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26 https: www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.  Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.  At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.  VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.  The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.  In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.  “The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.  “In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”  Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.  Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.  “We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”  Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.  It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”  Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.  The “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.  Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.  “Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.  Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.  Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.  VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING? Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.  This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.  Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.  “The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.  Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.  But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.  When asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”  The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.  https: www.marketwatch.com/story/squeeze-on-goldman-put-falcone-in-penalty-box-2013-08-21  Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.  He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.  In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.  Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.  It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.  As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.  In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.  Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.  Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)  This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.  That’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.  Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.  The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.  “Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.  I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.  “Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.  https: moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/  [Removed to keep within character limit]  https: nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/  After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.  The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.  But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.  Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.  The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.  Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.  “There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.  Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.  Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”  Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.  Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.  “Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.  Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.  But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.  “We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.  Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.  Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.  Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.  Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.  https: medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d  The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.  At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.  With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.  Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.  Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda: “Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.” This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.  Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.  Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.  Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned. Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.  Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.  From The Great Game:  “Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”  Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”  Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”  Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.  “The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‘short of Harlem’, meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’”"

FSLY,1,91," [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).

Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates"
PAI,1,1," Not sure how you arrived at that conclusion. I only stated that Biden has ""just"" taken office. There is no way his team will let the market go belly up and have GME define his presidency. It won't happen. It's not about WHO the current president is but rather the overall climate of the country. Please enlighten me on what the worst situation is? What $200, $300 a share? You're out of your mind if you think this is going to sub $50 anytime soon.  Ape's WILL GET PAID AND LAND ON MOON..

SINC,1,14832," Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000.

In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post!

FICO,1,9," First, FHA loans are the worst of all agency loans. Lower FICOs, lower down payments, etc. In addition, Freddie, Fannie and Ginnie are working to help borrowers refinance if needed. I believe you only need 3 months of payments now to qualify for a refinance.   Second, subscribe to MBA. They send out daily emails and update deliquencies on a weekly basis. I work in the mortgage industry, FBs are headed down to manageable levels. I don't believe anyone is preparing or hedging for a crash.   Another free daily blog is put out by Rob Chrisman and almost everyone I know in the mortgage industry reads it."

Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.

But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc.

Bruh... there are not infinite cheat codes for these guys. Blowing their load trying to stop what was happening in January worked to a point, BUT it also put a TREMENDOUS amount of global scrutiny on the situation. That has been and will be working against them.  There's a LOT less tolerance for big money fuckery with GME et al at this point. It already went in front of Congress, so there's no doubt that all eyes are on the situation -- the feigned ignorance and confusion from MMs, RH, Citadel, etc. won't work again for them.   The options left to extricate them are dwindling... beyond what they can do, IMHO, the only remaining possibility to stop the inevitable MOASS would be interventions by regulators, etc. that would be so absolutely cataclysmic to the entire market, global confidence in the system, etc.   Regulators and big money damn sure aren't going to burn the whole market down to save a few players from imploding in historical fashion."

Without overly complicating things, if the risk free increases the discount rate increases and the net present value of the cashflows decrease. Hence the decrease in value."
CLDR,1,21," I've been lurking here since 2018.  I've been an active WSB community since mid-2019. I remember when WSB was just another Reddit sub with 300,000 members.  I've watched the community storylines of WSB grow greater in grandeur. I'm tempted to call WSB a household name.  What makes WSB so unique from the hundreds, maybe thousands, of stock message boards out there is that the v loose comradery that unites this community together. WSB now affects real change.  So what's next?  WSB likes GameSt0nk. We do not like Robbinhood. So when Robinhood IPOs we should steer clear right? Wrong. The Robbinhood IPO opens the door for new ownership and therefore new leadership. WSB could own and operate Robinhood. We'll have to wait for the details of the IPO, but simply put we could own it.  This would be achieved by accumulating enough stock and then WSB coming together as a minority (or majority) shareholder group. Next is voting rights, then a board member, and eventually a new CEO. This won't happen quickly though...just like the other stonk we all like, it'll be a lengthy war of attrition. It's still worth it though. If you're doing it right, D14m0nd1ng a stonk forever should be effortless.  TL;DR - buying Robbinhood shares might be the contrarian play that we need right now.  PS - Before anyone spouts off about Robbinhood reading this and now being wise to the idea, settle down. You'd be out of your hair brained, ape mind if you think they hadn't thought about something along these lines pre IPO. Well have to wait for the details but with 10m members, it shouldn't be very difficult to own a major chunk.  Positions:CLDR $25c for 1/23ET $8c for 7/21  EDIT: I don't think they'll sell off a majority in the IPO..but who knows. They need a lot of money, billions. They may be just stoopid enough to sell a majority to the public at IPO. What's the reason behind the confidential IPO? Regardless, at some stage insiders will sell and/or they'll need to raise more money. They could eventually end up selling off a majority stake. On the other hand, by WSB holding a significant amount of available shares, we could force them to dilute their company into nothingness because if they ever sold a majority, WSB could quite literally own it and then we're one step closer to that WSB hedgefund that was always a joke, but now a real possibility. Lastly, the shareholder meetings at Robinhood would serve as a great WSB convention. I know this idea isn't popular, especially not right now. I wanted to put it out there anyway.  Edit 2: It is vlad. You got me guys. Sorry about burning all of you over and over again. Does anyone know if this year is a leap year? I hope my app doesn't go down again or whatever. But in the end, I don't really care. Can I get a ban?"
PYPL,1,91," [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates"

PROM,1,2886," BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.  **Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.  Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.  It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.  **Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.  Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.  Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.  **RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!  **Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.  **How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.  **Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.  **The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https: investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)  The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.  STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)  **EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.  Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.  ""There’s some shady stuff going down.

COMB,1,337," In **RKT DD Part I**, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. **Refer to RKT DD Part I Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)  In **RKT DD Part II** I discuss Rocket’s infectious culture from an employee’s (my own) perspective and why it will allow them to be the Amazon on Fintech. **Refer to RKT DD Part II Below:**  [https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt\_dd\_part\_ii\_a\_former\_employees\_take\_on\_rockets/](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt_dd_part_ii_a_former_employees_take_on_rockets/)     **RKT DD PART III:**  Now I want to address you dumbasses who lump Rocket in with United Wholesale Mortgage Company and Loan Depot.  *LoOk HoW LoAn DePoT aNd UwMc ArE DoInG – MoRtGaGe CoMpAnIeS SuCk*  Listen you simpletons, Rocket Companies OWNS THE ENTIRE HOUSING ECOSYSTEM:  * From the Front end with their **Rocket Homes** business (Zillow, Redfin competitor) * To the origination of the loan via **Rocket Mortgage** (whether direct to consumer or through their broker channel) * To their **Amrock** title insurance business which orders the appraisals and title insurance * To their **Nexsys Solutions** with tools that allow for Remote Online Notarization, enabling the mortgage process to be 100% digital * And with their **servicing business** which allows them to think about their clients on a lifetime perspective rather than on just a transactional level.  As they continue to grow their entire housing ecosystem, they are also leveraging their tech platform for other ancillary businesses such as Rocket Loans and Rocket Auto.  Link to all of Rocket’s companies below:  [https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/](https: www.rocketcompanies.com/our-companies/)  **Let’s talk Rocket Auto:**  Investors mistakenly think that Rocket Auto hasn’t launched Yet. It’s true Rocket Auto hasn’t launched *publicly* but it doesn’t mean Rocket Auto hasn’t launched. **Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales, marketing and customer service.** Rocket even powers their e-commerce platform. They literally run every part of Vroom’s business except for the delivery of the vehicle.  If you look at VROOM’s 10Q, you’ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4-year agreement with VRM. The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8,641,914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four-year period, in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket’s e-commerce platform. That’s $430M worth of shares. Let’s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom (2015) so we don’t even know how much he already owns. See section of Vroom’s 10Q below:  *Paragraph in VRM 10Q: “On May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Rocket”) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the “Rocket Auto” brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the “RA Agreement”). The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform, but all sales of the Company’s inventory will be conducted through the Company’s platform.* ***Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2021*** *and, during the term of the RA Agreement, Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory. The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company’s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement.* ***The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period*** *based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.”*  As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter…and **what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday’s earnings report?** A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don’t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted.  I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom – why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn’t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it’s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly.  **Why is used car sales good for Rocket?**  Because Data, Data, Data.  Rocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans  Rocket can very easily have access to half of America’s homeowners credit reports by 2030 – The jackpot of consumer data.  What does a credit report tell you? **It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off.** This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform.  Look at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana’s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket’s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket’s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus – to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world’s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate.  Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes **1 million decisions per day** and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions.  Not to mention, ***Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales***\*\*.\*\* We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep – and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana’s presence.  **Rocket Homes:**  *WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW:*  Dear smooth brain, please download “Rocket Homes” on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow.  I’ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won’t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes.  I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket’s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial).  Not going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B – A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET’s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED.  **Rocket’s expansion internationally:**  Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B.  We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country.  Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket’s Lendesk fits the Bill.  Unfortunately these dumbass mods won’t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/) Link below:  [https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https: www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)  This international expansion (along with Rocket’s other ancillary businesses) highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started.  **Short Squeeze**  Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares – but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares.  Despite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market.  To combat this unnecessary shorting, **Rocket announced a $1B buyback**; currently their float is $2B.  First off, who even announces a buyback when they’ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of.  Rocket’s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday’s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover?  Initially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn’t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn’t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August – that’s how much he believes in this company.  Gilbert has a big ego – so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron’s Fathead to Benedict Arnold’s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America’s biggest traitor*. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below:  [https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/](https: nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/)  This was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect.  Just like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I’m sure he’s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close).  Fun fact – even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James’ departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship… Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below:  [https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000](https: www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000)  **But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren’t they buying back shares at these these levels?**  Answer: because they likely can’t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain.  According to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading.  What is material information? Material information is any information that hasn’t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released.  What is Rocket's ""non-public material information"":  * The announcement of Rocket’s big, new financial partner * The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto  This information is likely to be made public on Thursday’s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float. And to put fuel on the fire, Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back, that is, if there are any shares left for purchase.  Gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs, imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into.  Say it with me now: Rocket Bears are Fucked.

WEI,1,455," Very long post summarising hundreds of years worth of short squeezes.  Edited for formatting.  Positions: GME 65 shares @ $105.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/eddie-gilbert-the-boy-wonder-of-wall-street#:~:text=On%20June%2012%2C%201958%2C%20the,remaining%2050%25%20of%20Bruce%20stock.  Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.  The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis  Saunders vs. the Shorts Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.   The Shorts Are Cornered Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.   Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.   https: www.americanheritage.com/jacob-schiff-and-northern-pacific-corner#2  In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.  Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.  On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.  Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.  By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.  Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.  The New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.  https: www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26 https: www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.  Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.  At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.  VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.  The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.  In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.  “The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.  “In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”  Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.  Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.  “We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”  Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.  It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”  Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.  The “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.  Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.  “Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.  Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.  Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.  VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING? Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.  This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.  Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.  “The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.  Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.  But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.  When asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”  The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.  https: www.marketwatch.com/story/squeeze-on-goldman-put-falcone-in-penalty-box-2013-08-21  Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.  He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.  In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.  Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.  It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.  As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.  In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.  Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.  Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)  This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.  That’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.  Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.  The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.  “Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.  I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.  “Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.  https: moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/  [Removed to keep within character limit]  https: nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/  After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.  The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.  But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.  Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.  The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.  Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.  “There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.  Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.  Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”  Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.  Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.  “Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.  Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.  But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.  “We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.  Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.  Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.  Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.  Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.  https: medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d  The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.  At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.  With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.  Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.  Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda: “Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.” This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.  Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.  Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.  Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned. Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.  Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.  From The Great Game:  “Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”  Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”  Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”  Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.  “The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‘short of Harlem’, meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’”"

Then I check an hour later, and it double sold me so I was short UAL! Now, it ended up making me money in the end so I didn't care, but I've been careful since. That's wild it happened to you too"

Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys!

AGEN,1,455," Very long post summarising hundreds of years worth of short squeezes.  Edited for formatting.  Positions: GME 65 shares @ $105.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/eddie-gilbert-the-boy-wonder-of-wall-street#:~:text=On%20June%2012%2C%201958%2C%20the,remaining%2050%25%20of%20Bruce%20stock.  Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.  The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis  Saunders vs. the Shorts Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.   The Shorts Are Cornered Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.   Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.   https: www.americanheritage.com/jacob-schiff-and-northern-pacific-corner#2  In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.  Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.  On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.  Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.  By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.  Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.  The New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.  https: www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26 https: www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.  Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.  At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.  VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.  The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.  In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.  “The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.  “In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”  Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.  Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.  “We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”  Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.  It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”  Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.  The “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.  Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.  “Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.  Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.  Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.  VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING? Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.  This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.  Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.  “The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.  Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.  But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.  When asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”  The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.  https: www.marketwatch.com/story/squeeze-on-goldman-put-falcone-in-penalty-box-2013-08-21  Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.  He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.  In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.  Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.  It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.  As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.  In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.  Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.  Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)  This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.  That’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.  Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.  The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.  “Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.  I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.  “Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.  https: moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/  [Removed to keep within character limit]  https: nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/  After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.  The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.  But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.  Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.  The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.  Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.  “There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.  Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.  Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”  Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.  Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.  “Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.  Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.  But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.  “We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.  Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.  Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.  Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.  Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.  https: medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d  The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.  At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.  With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.  Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.  Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda: “Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.” This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.  Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.  Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.  Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned. Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.  Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.  From The Great Game:  “Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”  Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”  Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”  Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.  “The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‘short of Harlem’, meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’”"

NNY,1,790," Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰  Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:  When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.  RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself).   $RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back.   It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT.   BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?  GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you.   The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.  Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November.   Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.  BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:  Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?    TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌   Edit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40. To those who have family members who are special needs, I apologize - I am merely speaking the language of my targeted audience (WSB)  Positions: https: imgur.com/a/DbOCCYG (PTON is another story for another time) **NOTE:** I also have another 60k of RKT in my Roth.

TLT,1,281," TLT has bottomed and is seemingly bouncing of the support. This will bring down the yield, thus making growth and equities attractive again  Friday we saw yields going down significantly. This only makes me convinced 1.5 on 10Y is the resistance. What made people buy bonds? I think the market correction made money flow into bonds again as it is a safe haven asset class, even on current levels. Paradoxically, we might see this movement between bonds and equities oscillate for a few more weeks violently, before it settles on a level  $1.9T stimulus is already priced in and it won't be factor affecting the current market. However, any deviation from this figure might have an impact. If it is greater than $1.9T, bonds are sold on fears of inflation, thus driving up the yield. And vice versa. A greater stimulus can also makes TLT drop below support which would be scary and not what we want.  Lastly, Fed for sure is monitoring the movement in the long dated yield. They have consistently mentioned that inflation is not an issue long term and that they still have enough tools at their disposal to control the yield curve. In case yields break off and go above 1.5 parabolically, I think they will jump in and start participating in buying the long dated bonds, which they haven't done yet - they have only been buying the short dated bonds so far.  Why would Fed want to control the long dated yield? To save the stock market? Nope. That's not their primary goal, but equities do benefit from their measure. They will buy long dated bonds because they want more borrowers in the economy than lenders. Especially given the fact their target is to boost employment, which would happen if they keep companies afloat - yes, even the zombie ones, which should ideally go out of business anyway. But that's a concern for the future. At this point, Fed is least bothered about this particular underlying problem."

MAA,1,455," Very long post summarising hundreds of years worth of short squeezes.  Edited for formatting.  Positions: GME 65 shares @ $105.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/eddie-gilbert-the-boy-wonder-of-wall-street#:~:text=On%20June%2012%2C%201958%2C%20the,remaining%2050%25%20of%20Bruce%20stock.  Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.  The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis  Saunders vs. the Shorts Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.   The Shorts Are Cornered Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.   Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.   https: www.americanheritage.com/jacob-schiff-and-northern-pacific-corner#2  In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.  Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.  On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.  Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.  By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.  Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.  The New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.  https: www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26 https: www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.  Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.  At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.  VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.  The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.  In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.  “The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.  “In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”  Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.  Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.  “We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”  Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.  It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”  Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.  The “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.  Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.  “Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.  Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.  Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.  VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING? Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.  This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.  Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.  “The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.  Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.  But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.  When asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”  The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.  https: www.marketwatch.com/story/squeeze-on-goldman-put-falcone-in-penalty-box-2013-08-21  Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.  He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.  In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.  Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.  It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.  As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.  In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.  Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.  Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)  This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.  That’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.  Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.  The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.  “Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.  I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.  “Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.  https: moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/  [Removed to keep within character limit]  https: nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/  After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.  The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.  But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.  Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.  The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.  Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.  “There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.  Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.  Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”  Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.  Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.  “Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.  Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.  But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.  “We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.  Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.  Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.  Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.  Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.  https: medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d  The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.  At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.  With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.  Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.  Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda: “Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.” This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.  Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.  Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.  Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned. Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.  Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.  From The Great Game:  “Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”  Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”  Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”  Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.  “The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‘short of Harlem’, meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’”"
VIRT,1,91," [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).

But hey if gme reaches 800$ it will be as big as dell, the london stock exchange, BMW, Volvo, bank on Montreal, UBS and eaton. Now .. I'm cut off from the wallstretbet thread, and I guarantee that's intentional... So people like me CANT talk some sense into the following soon to be bag holders. I'm trying to convince people that they're out of their minds and are going to get stuck holding not just a bag but a bag of s*** forever. Once once this flavor of the month goes away it's never going back to those prices again it's an old decaying dying model take a look at family video.

RETO,1,1, How is RETO?? Do you think of another NIO??
GILD,1,4," “it’s more risky to not have a share of GME as a hedge against market collapse.”  No. Equities de-risk in a market collapse — GME will not inflate further. GME has a Beta of 1.95, meaning it’s nearly two times as volatile as the overall market. It’s not an inverse correlation, it’s 2X as correlated.    No one knows what will trigger the next collapse. On average a 10% market decline happens 2.5 times per year. Will this be a depression, recession, or simply a correction. No one knows. But returns on capital are 2X the rate of return on economic output. They stimulus is fueling economic output — capital will follow suit. But meme stocks like GME and AMC haven’t yet proven how they will reinvent themselves for high Returns on Capital. No doubt, there’s a thesis for GME — like Ryan Cohen’s idea to turn GME into a digital gaming powerhouse — but this will take time to play out. But it’s more likely that market downturns will happen between now and then, and GME will decline more than market in such a scenario.  If you believe in it’s transformation, there may be buying opportunities. But stocks don’t cuddle. GME as a tendie will fade, just as all tendies do. If you want to protect yourself in a market correction, look to well capitalized companies with strong cash flow. Even better, companies that are delevering, reducing debt, buying back shares. Berkshire Hathaway BRK-B, BMY, GILD all have Betas less than 1. These are the types of stocks to own if you believe zombie stocks (with higher debt interest than earnings) will get crushed soon. Example of zombie stocks are Macy’s and Exxon.  Best of luck."
BH,1,1," They had great earnings and it’s a highly shorted stock with low float (though a significant amount of shorts have covered in the past month). TBH I’ve always wondered if the original mistake was people buying AMC instead of AMCX not the other way around.  Anyway I expect the price will drift lower but I’d buy puts, not short, just in case. It’s still 4 days to cover."
ASM,1,2, AMD is by far better than ASML on profit margin IMO
KLIC,1,2," KLIC - supplies the manufacturing equipment, has no debt and is trading below the PE of its peers. The analysts consensus is a price target of $59.50 but if demand for their product keeps growing then that will increase too.  Not a yolo, good fundamentals and in a steady uptrend. It needs to break through $52.5 as this is the current ceiling on the trading range, if it doesn't then it will form a double top which is bearish from a TA perspective but I think its got the momentum to push through."

MAAX,1,455," Very long post summarising hundreds of years worth of short squeezes.  Edited for formatting.  Positions: GME 65 shares @ $105.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/eddie-gilbert-the-boy-wonder-of-wall-street#:~:text=On%20June%2012%2C%201958%2C%20the,remaining%2050%25%20of%20Bruce%20stock.  Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.  The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.  https: globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis  Saunders vs. the Shorts Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.   The Shorts Are Cornered Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.   Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.   https: www.americanheritage.com/jacob-schiff-and-northern-pacific-corner#2  In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.  Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.  On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.  Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.  By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.  Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.  The New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.  https: www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26 https: www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.  Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.  At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.  VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.  The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.  In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.  “The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.  “In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”  Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.  Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.  “We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”  Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.  It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”  Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.  The “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.  Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.  “Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.  Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.  Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.  VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING? Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.  This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.  Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.  “The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.  Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.  But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.  When asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”  The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.  https: www.marketwatch.com/story/squeeze-on-goldman-put-falcone-in-penalty-box-2013-08-21  Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.  He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.  In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.  Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.  It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.  As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.  In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.  Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.  Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)  This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.  That’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.  Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.  The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.  “Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.  I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.  “Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.  https: moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/  [Removed to keep within character limit]  https: nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/  After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.  The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.  But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.  Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.  The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.  Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.  “There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.  Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.  Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”  Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.  Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.  “Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.  Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.  But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.  “We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.  Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.  Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.  Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.  Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.  https: medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d  The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.  At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.  With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.  Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.  Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda: “Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.” This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.  Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.  Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.  Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned. Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.  Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.  From The Great Game:  “Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”  Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”  Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”  Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.  “The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‘short of Harlem’, meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’”"

HAIN,1,44,"    Grocery Outlet is a boomer bet with overtones of possible insane growth.                            First, the bedrock boomer shit. Grocery outlet buys strategically so they can offer products for 50% to 70% cheaper than the competition., Essentially, they allow my broke ass to eat organic ribeye every night if i so choose.   GO has just 375 locations in 6 states.   Their most recent 10k was released in 2019 and stated they have a longterm potential of 4,800 locations nationwide. GO is just getting started.  Their longterm growth is projected as 14.7% as compared to industries 12.4% in 2019.   They plan to expand their number of locations by at least 10% a year. This alone gets my dong hard.  As stated in their 10k, their management is not accustomed to operating a publicly owned business. This sounds bad, but is actually a good thing imo. GO is already an amazing business model. Imagine if an Ackman/R. Cohen type character came in and bought a huge chunk or the company installed a few heavy hitters to help scale the business.In fact,last week they added Maria Fernanda Meija(former VP Kellogg's) and Gail Moody-byrd(AI marketing analytics at noodle.ai)  to the board.           The above would be enough to get me to invest if i were a boomer, but as a WSB mutant, I need a possibility of a tendie volcano. Now for storytime.  HOW GROCERY OUTLET OFFERS DEEP DISCOUNTS If a store overstocks, a truck gets misdirected, packaging changes, production changes, or any such interruption in the ""Chain of freshness"" occurs, GO capitalizes on this while saving the other company from taking losses.        THE CHAIN OF FRESHNESS  You may have heard that up to a third of all food produced by Americans is thrown away. https: www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/491513/  The Chain of Freshness describes how this happens and how food MOVES. 1. Food is grown  2. Food sent to be processed and/or packaged/branded. 3. It goes to warehouse(this  sometimes involves many layers of regional and local warehouses.) 4. It goes to a store 5.You buy it.  Anywhere during this chain, product can get slowed down. It wont be fresh enough to  be accepted at the next checkpoint in the Chain, so it goes into a dumpster. Although the ""actual freshness"" of the product may be fresher than you would ever see at a store, its not fresh enough to  go to regional, then local distributors before landing at the store not only fresh enough to consume, but fresh enough to be able to sit on the shelf for however long is required by the stores business plan.   This would be a good time to state that im technically an ""industry insider"" as ive been dumpster diving for years. Ive seen warehouse dumpsters full to the top with product all packaged and nice, fresher than you would ever see at a store. You may have heard in the news recently about portland police guarding dumpsters full of food from citizens. Fred Meyer said the food was spoiled, but it was just unsellable due to liability issues and food quality laws. Perfectly edible food. https: apnews.com/article/portland-storms-oregon-4eebd2cd2f1b9f798667994bc871a647  This is just the tip of the iceberg, as warehouse dumpsters are usually behind fences and guarded with cameras so no one sees that waste, except for me. I fill my backpack with organic chocolate, hipflasks of brandy, and have personally recovered enough frozen marinated ribs to grill up and play Meat Jenga with(which we actually did.)  This waste is caused by logistics problems which could be alleviated by Grocery Outlet, adding value to everyone involved                   Now imagine this company if Food Waste Laws are passed, penalizing companies who waste food. With images of cops chasing people away from a dumpster full of perfectly good food in the news, the discussion is very likely to surface among other progressive talking points. Grocery Outlet is uniquely positioned to profit from this trend. If Companies were all of a sudden compelled to reduce their waste, it would be a huge growth opportunity. Just based on their current guidance GO is a great bet. But in this rapidly changing world, a newly public company like GO with an innovative business model can change its current guidance multiple times.  Tldr; a long standing glitch in the logistics of how we sell and move food around leads to dumpsters full of perfectly good food that makes up about a third of all the food Americans produce.

FORU,1,54," \*This is not financial advice and I’m not a licensed or registered securities analyst/provider. Basically, I know nothing so do listen to me. Just some context to what is happing and a guess on what the Pro's will do as they continue to manipulate GME.  Difference between Options and betting on a football game. Betting on a football game doesn’t affect the outcome. If enough people buy call options it can affect the outcome.  **Conclusion: Pro’s will BANG THE CLOSE on Thursday March 18th for April 1 Call options**  Apparently, the Pro’s are buying call option positions at the close somewhat near where the stock is trading (at the money) causing the market makers to delta hedge (estimated .66) and buy shares in the open market. For every contract (100 shares) the market makers sell at the money (near current price), they will need to hedge by buying about .66 (delta) shares on the open market. Buying pressure can increase the price sparking more interest (feedback loop).This is how the bet influences the outcome. This is the way.  The last two months they did it in the last trading week of the month. I’m thinking they could disguise their intent by executing their strategy the week before GME reports Q4 earnings. They haven’t been waiting til Friday so my guess is it would take place earlier maybe on Wednesday or Thursday. Friday the 19th is Quadruple Witching day so volatility in the overall market will be higher.  BANG THE FORUM would also fuel the rocketship. Hedge Funds are spying on the reddit forum (Point 2). They have programs to scrape every letter on this forum and calculate sentiment.  I could see them buying contracts and faking an increase in sentiment by posting the letters GME in a lot of replies so it looks like [r/wallstreetbets](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) are about to go gang busters on GME. If the letters GME show up in many post replies then everyone will be thinking that redditors are about to buy a lot of GME. The idiot hedge funds will go out and buy stock/options to front run the retail investor. If the [r/wallstreetbets](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) crowd also included “GME” in replies it could further fuel it as the Pro’s manipulate the market. This is the way.  [**Point 0: Movement in GME is repeatable (feedback loop)**](https: www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/25/nothing-specific-caused-gamestop-rally-says-strategist.html?&qsearchterm=Nothing%20specific%20caused%20GameStop%20rally)  (click up here \^\^\^ for CNBC video \^\^\^)  Catalyst relatively simple (feedback loop)….we started to tick up on Thursday and got above $50. THEN major option trades went off fueling the rocketship to the moon! Parabolic!!  2:58pm stock at $53, 750 contracts at $50 strike expire tomorrow (1 day) paid $6.85 (about $500k). Within 10 mins stock at $68 or so and not long later dropped to $60  3:27pm stock at $60.80, 400 contracts at $60 strike $7.75 (about $300k)  (Feedback loop) People on the other side of the trade (sellers of contracts) have to hedge and buy shares. Craziness will happen with only 20 minutes left to the close. All this from ONLY $800k in call option activity!! That’s nothing….a little skeptical.  [**Point 1: SEC former regulator foreshadows next squeeze (End of March)**](https: www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/26/there-are-institutional-traders-behind-gamestop-frenzy-former-sec-regulator.html)  (click up here \^\^\^ for CNBC video \^\^\^)  First Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the January  Second Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the February (not as many short sellers)  Projected Third Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the March (huge month for trade, month and quarter end)  **Point 2: Hedge Funds spying on** [r/wallstreetbets](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)\*\*, use it against them\*\*  Investors (HF’s, Institutions, etc.) are paying service providers to spy on the forum and count everytime someone mentions Gamestop or the ticker. They are tracking the sentiment of the forum to front run the action. If you talk about Gamestop a lot and type in the ticker then each mention gets counted and if there is a significant increase then the HF’s may consider buying the stock and/or options to participate in any increase before it goes parabolic.  **Point 3: Q4 2020 earnings expected to be out in “late March”**  I expect the earnings date will be announced two weeks prior, so that puts you around March 8th Monday to March 11th Thursday. Earnings date probably between 23rd to the 25th, two weeks after the announcement of the date.  11/24/2020 (Tuesday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/08/2020 (Tuesday)  08/26/2020 (Wednesday) GME announces Q2 earnings release on 09/09/2020 (Wednesday)  05/28/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q1 earnings release on 06/09/2020 (Tuesday)  03/12/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q4 earnings release on 03/26/2019 (Thursday)  11/25/2019 (Monday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/10/2019 (Tuesday)  **Point 4: Options Cubed - GME is spring loaded for volatility**  The somewhat binary outcome of survive or die combined with a very credible activist investor (Ryan C.) is accelerated with material changes and establishing a better alignment with the secular tailwinds of gaming.  Buying call options is like an option on an option on an option, Options Cubed. For that reason, you would expect them to be priced accordingly. However, even after the first squeeze massively help by the short sellers, we sat in the $40-$60 range with out of the money call options price extremely cheap. As if they were normal options. Let’s see how cheaply someone is willing to sell a $70 call option if this stock tanks to the $50s next week.  **Point 5: Probability says buy April 1 Call options**  You don’t know when the parabolic moves will happen but the media clips above in point 2 suggest it will happen in the last week of the month. Since you don’t know when, the task is the following:  Detail Outcomes --> Assign Probabilities (subjective) --> Calculate Expected Value  Lets say next week GME drops to the $50-$60 range and out of the money call options are cheap like the aftermath of the first squeeze.  15x return --> 10% chance of another move just simply to $100 (a $60 Strike call option would be worth about $45 to $60 with a stock price move to $100 again)  0x return --> 90% chance we never get above $50 again  Expected Value = (15x \* .1) + (0x \* .9) = 1.5x return  On average a 50% return is expected. So if you think there is a greater than 10% chance of another move to $100 once it falls to the $50-$60 range then the expected return only goes up assuming you can get at least a 15x return on your contract."

SAVA,1,5," Shorting has its merits, but in my opinion there needs to be transparency as well as a hard cap on the % of float that can be shorted. Shorting is too easy for the hedgies to use and abuse which they can and do at will with enough volume to have a noticeably negative impact. They don’t usually do it because of the fundamentals, but for profit. It’s bullshit what they can do to a stock - screwing over honest ppl who actually believe in the stock they invested in by shorting it to increase their profitability. Apple is the most valuable company in the world. They had a great earnings call this month. No reason to lose over 10 bucks of share in value like they have. I saw SAVA and TLRY shoot up in value and close at I think 117 and 65 or so respectively one day. Why? So higher OTM options are rolled out the next day. What happens the next day? Price falls by 50% rendering those OTM calls useless. First time GME shot to 150 - they were allowed to because they stopped shorting for a brief period. Why? To have any limit sells trigger in the 100-150 range and that day 150 was the highest OTM call option available. Shenanigans!!"

ACMR,1,1," Sound advice. When you sell, you own nothing, you have no claim from that point on. When you hold, you at least still own something and you have a claim, what potential that yields is hard to say at times but it's more than nothing. Think of a store that has inventory sitting on the shelf for what is determined to suddenly be too long. Do they just toss it into the dumpster and take a total loss? They shouldn't, someone would pay something for it. So selling at a loss is certainly better than a total loss, but in the world of stonks how would they go into the dumpster? If they do, the least of your worries should be about losing all your money but instead how did you convince yourself to buy in the first place. But what factor does this point have which changes things? Time. This is why suddenly a store decides, shelf space could be better used, space (volume) and time. They think a different product on the shelf will perform better with the shelf space over the same or less amount of time. But what if they could simply take a loss on a little of the shitty product and use the remaining shelf space towards a little of the new product? Space and time equilibrium. You don't have to dump everything if you only need a little space with the same amount of time to make up. Time is everything because you're dying and only have so much left but volume is important too.     From a hypothetical point, I would expect something like GME to spike about every month. Why? People get paid, monthly debts are settled. Now, I can't say for sure that GME will trend like most stocks where the highs just diminish over time, but people are losing on it, no doubt about that, each and every time that happens it removes potential capital which could go into that stock in the next buy frenzy. Then there's the subjective aspect, people don't like the unpredictable when it starts to really hurt, so they avoid, at the same time people inherently understand, nothing lasts forever, so they avoid. Either way, the spikes get smaller and smaller each month.     The last spike only produced about 280% compared to the \~2100% in Jan. I can capture that in 56 days of regular trading with a lot less risk. True I might be able to shave off a lot of time IF I max out the margin on GME and IF I was right about it and with much less equity. OR, I could just continue at 5% daily gains which I get. Something I see people not considering is a fixed amount they need by the end of the \~250 trading days, a real amount. I know what I want to make and only make in that year. Getting to the moon is not priority, priority is a real number I'm going to put on my returns every year. Everything changes once that is factored in. The way I look at charts, I'm not just interested in how deep or how high, I'm really interested in what is the absolute longest time in a dip, what is the average time in a gain. And if I can't determine that because there is so much noise, it's excluded. There's volatility which I like, I actually need to meet that daily average and then there's just pure chaos. That determines what I do with that stock. So far, since the early 90's, I've been doing well, very well considering and I started as simply selecting with what was essentially someone else's money because I was too young. I've known success, $100K (which started as $10K) in Apple in 2006 because someone bought me an iPod for my birthday, something I knew absolutely nothing about and it encouraged me to research. But I really like pattern trading. So in college I started.     With GME I would do this, wait until the third week of the month, buy with a limit that I think would give me a 20% gain and that's it, then back to sanity, if the limit fails to execute, I didn't want it anyways so don't care. Yeah, it really only would give me 4 days of trading that I can completely fuck up on, but that's 4 days, I'll take it. Don't get greedy, that's what fucks people, they get greedy and the best way to let greed destroy your returns is not determining what you need to earn before you buy as opposed to what you want to earn. Well fuck, I want ACMR to trade at Tesla prices, ok, that's not going to happen by then end of the year. There's absolutely nothing out there to suggest this (unless someone out here knows something I don't) LOL     Know how much you need at the end of a day, a month, a quarter and a year and use that to determine whether you stay in or out after you've already determined that the stock is reliable which is why you shouldn't have to worry about selling. IF at the end of a years trading you have more than expected, then you can dump it on shit like GME, it's bonus money if you want to see it that way because it was unexpected, but when you come up short the next year suddenly that money won't be looked at as a bonus anymore. If you are never able to view additional earnings as a bonus (which you won't be able to if you didn't establish a necessary end amount to begin with), stay away from things that are unpredictable, that the universe says, this would be a complete anomaly and is unnatural and you will never have to sell at a loss because it will never stay as a permanent loss.     That being said....I have about $85K tied up into complete bullshit stocks right now....just waiting and no, I will never, ever sell until they at least start to break even several times and I've found something which will produce as well or better. I'm stubborn that way but that's the bonus money I really don't give a shit about. My seed has been out for about a month because I saw this coming. Some would say, no, this is the time to buy everything, no it's not because I haven't seen even a -4 on the Great Oscillator which is to be obeyed, period. We're getting there though. So instead of putting yourself in a position of not selling, try putting yourself in a position of not buying in the first place. Stop caring about missing opportunities that are only regretful with hindsight and start realizing dips are forever, they're infinite and you only need a few every now and then. Different ways of looking at things. I would rather miss a golden opportunity than to be denied the ability to trade when I want even if that meant I have puny returns in comparison. Reliability first and foremost, then Hail Mary's and if you can never part with your earnings, that's ok too.     As for sticking it to the man, I remember watching the floor getting cleaned up on Wednesdays on the boob tube and the movies sucked me in when I was a kid. Hedges et al will always be around, they will survive, it's all they do, I don't care if they get wealthier, I care about me getting wealthier cause I know way, way too many people rely on those guys....they're fucking impervious. But I sort of want them that way, I need more money in the market, last thing I want to do is reduce it, that would be like hoping everyone gets fucked so I can pick up stocks at the lowest prices in history because nobody has any money to buy them so they're worthless. Why the fuck would I want that? I say manipulate all you want, retail, hedge, who cares because at the end of the day, if you can't read the fine lines in the bullshit, you shouldn't be trading. That being said, let's all watch WKHS either destroy Wood or turn her into an oracle, like there hasn't been hundreds of those before right? Like they lose one contract and suddenly they might as well have never produced anything to this point!? So stupid. Never sell at a loss, k, never buy at a loss, never sell at a gain, never buy at a gain or DD and you don't have to worry about nevers. Big difference between a ""loss"" perceived and a loss achieved; sense of time, patience and calm and knowing where you wanted to be in the first place and did you have a plan and how much error is acceptable in the plan. That's as good as it gets. Now get out there you retards and start buying the shit out of ACMR...kidding, don't I need the price to be logical. LMAO"

CVX,1,790," Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰  Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:  When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.  RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself).   $RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back.   It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT.   BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?  GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you.   The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.  Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November.   Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.  BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:  Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?    TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌   Edit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40. To those who have family members who are special needs, I apologize - I am merely speaking the language of my targeted audience (WSB)  Positions: https: imgur.com/a/DbOCCYG (PTON is another story for another time) **NOTE:** I also have another 60k of RKT in my Roth.

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https: www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)  \----------  Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https: www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https: www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https: www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.  \----------  For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:  ""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF.

PRED,1,14832," Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!  &#x200B;  First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.  &#x200B;  Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**  &#x200B;  **9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.  https: preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4  **9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that  https: preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22  **1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)  https: preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572  **2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.  https: preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31  **3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.  https: preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787  NOW THE ANALYSIS:  **WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**  So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https: fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.  **WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**  Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.  https: preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb  **WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**  Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.  https: preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b  **WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**  Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.  IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!  &#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!  &#x200B;  **EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http: shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**  https: preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf  &#x200B;  **EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http: counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).  Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.  Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""  &#x200B;  **EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**  &#x200B;  **EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**  &#x200B;  EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.  &#x200B;  **Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**   &#x200B;  I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"

CBD,1,3," 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Aphria $APHA cultivates and sells medical and recreational cannabis through retail and wholesale channels in Canada and internationally.     🚀 On Dec. 16, Aphria and Tilray $TLRY announced a merger to form the largest cannabis company in the worldby revenue. The company will keep the Tilray name, including the ability to consolidate production in Canada, combine alcohol and CBD businesses in the United States in preparation for potential federal legalization, and the ability to combine efforts in Europe.    🚀 In a reverse merger structure, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share, implying a 23% premium to Tilray’s share price before the announcement. Given relative sizes, Aphria shareholders will own about 60% of the combined company and get seven of the nine board seats. Tilray CEO and Chairman Brendan Kennedy will get one of Tilray’s two board seats, while Aphria CEO and Chairman Irwin Simon will keep both roles in the combined company.    🚀 Its pending merger with Tilray boosts its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Deal terms seem fair to both sides. Aphria added recreational cannabis after Canada’s legalization in October 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Aphria’s recreational and wholesale cannabis revenue accounted for roughly 41% of total cannabis and distribution revenue. Unlike many of Aphria’s competitors that immediately focused on creating consumer packaged goods for the recreational market, Aphria initially focused on flower and vape. However, it is now beginning to expand into edibles.    🚀 On Feb. 1, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Ron Wyden announced their intentions to push major federal cannabis legislation. They plan to release a discussion draft in the early part of this year. Legalization is likely going to take a couple of years, as forecasts estimate a change to federal law by 2023. Nevertheless, legalization sooner than that would unlock growth and capital access sooner but doesn’t change our estimated market potential of $85 billion by 2030 compared with an estimated $15 billion in 2020, according to the Marijuana Business Daily.    🚀 Aphria has an extensive international distribution business, which generated the majority of net revenue in 2020, a far larger portion than many of its Canadian cannabis peers. The global market looks lucrative given higher realized prices and growing acceptance of the medical benefits of cannabis. Exportersbmust pass strict regulations to enter markets, which protects early entrants like Aphria. Due to climate, much of Canada’s cultivation is in greenhouses or indoors. Recent expansions in outdoor production are likely limited to extracted products due to quality. Aphria revised plans to build production in Colombia due to high capital costs, instead exporting global medical markets from its Canadian facilities.     🚀 Forecast estimate roughly 16% average annual growth through 2030 for the global medicinal market excluding Canada and the U.S. Aphria's 2020 acquisition of SweetWater, a U.S. craft brewery, still leaves it out of the U.S. THC or CBD market. Its strategy appears to predict that future cannabis distribution looks more like alcohol or tobacco than the current multi-state operator strucure of today. The U.S. offers the fastest growth of any market globally. However, the regulatory environment is murky with individual states legalizing cannabis while it remains illegal federally.  Federal law will eventually be changed to allow states to choose the legality of cannabis within their borders.    TLDR;;  🚀🚀🚀🚀 Aphria's merger with Tilray grows its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Aphria’s focus on strategic SG&A spending and running a lean business model allows it to have a healthy cash balance to fund future operations and investments. Aphria's careful approach to expansion has allowed it to reach profitability faster than any of its Canadian peers."
XPEV,1,91," [Welcome back to the casino](https: i.imgur.com/rWUea2Z.jpg).   **Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA  **Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**  **On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD  *I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.*   ****  When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.  **Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day.   Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.  ****  **1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**  On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.

Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.

EB,1,34," This analysis looks at one possible break-up scenario of the Rite Aid corporation that projects a return of more than 2.5X the closing share price of $19.58 on Friday, February 26, 2021.  Rite Aid (RAD) consists of two (2) parts:  1. The Retail Pharmacy business currently generating approximately $16 billion in annual revenues. 2. The Prescription Benefits Management (PBM) services business known as ELIXIR, currently generating approximately $8 billion in annual revenues.  One possible scenario for unlocking the value of RAD involves the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business and Rite Aid brand.  What is left is the ELIXIR PBM organization.  Here is an estimation of how such an approach might play out:  * In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash.  That represents an average price of $2.275 million per store. * Should RAD seek a buyer for its Retail Pharmacy business, it could sell its 2,450 remaining stores as well as the Rite Aid brand.  Despite the fact that many of these stores are located in highly attractive locations (CA, OH, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, VA, etc), let's discount the average value of each store by 20% (compared to the average price-per-store paid by Walgreens), and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $1.8 million per store. * At a average price of $1.8 million per store, RAD could reasonably generate proceeds of $4.4 billion with the sale of the entire Retail Pharmacy business, including the 2,450 locations and the Rite Aid brand name (assigning no good will value to the brand). * The remaining RAD organization essentially consists of a PBM branded as ELIXIR and a net amount of cash on hand of +$1.2 billion, assuming that $3.2 billion of the Retail Pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing long-term debt on the company's books. * ELIXIR's projected sales for RAD's fiscal year 2021 (ending February 2021) are approximately $8 billion.  During each of the past four (4) quarters, RAD has reported ELIXIR's year-over-year growth rate to be in the range of  23 - 29%. * ELIXIR's projected EBITDA for fiscal 2022 (begining March of 2021) will likely be approximately $200 million.  Once again, I am taking a conservative estimate, and basically considering that a business that has grown 23 - 29% each quarter for the past year, will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year. * With only 55,000,000 shares outstanding today, the $200 million EBITDA generated by ELIXIR translates to roughly $3.60 per share in earnings.  Using a highly conservative PE multiple of 8, a stock price of $28.80 results.   However, the cash-on-hand of $1.2 billion (from the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business after long-term debt payoff) produces additional value of $22.00 per share, resulted in a stock price value of more than $50 per share (which is more than 2.5X the closing price of $19.58 on Friday, February 26, 2021). * The newly created company, ELIXIR, would be well-positioned for growth in the small-to-mid-size opportunity segment of the $400 billion per year PBM industry.  With a net $1.2 billion in cash, that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition.  In conclusion, this analysis indicates that the conservative value of RAD today is $50 per share, well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market, which is just under $20.  The purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the Rite Aid corporation is the best strategic path forward.  (I personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $100 in the next 12 - 24 months if it keeps the entire organization fully in tact.)  Rather, the purpose of the post was to reveal the hidden value locked within RAD that is clearly being overlooked by the investment community, by analyzing one possible break-up scenario."
PRPL,1,1," $PRPL gang! I’m hoping for a nice lift off. News should be great.  $WKHS Luckily I bought at $10.11. I should have sold at $40, but that’s the way the cards fell. Hoping for some great news this week."

ITI,1,4365," Hi fellow retards!  My hypothesis and granted this may have already been postulated here is that the hedgers had enough liquidity in Jan to short GME and temper the price back down. Now it appears that they’ve run out of liquidity and are forced to sell their income generating securities to continue to short in an act of desperation.   As a parallel - consider it from a mortgage perspective they’re trying to stave of foreclosure by first burning through savings and now they’re selling off their valuable possessions. So they can’t borrow off margin, they are out of cash and now they’re selling off their source of income. Which by the way hurts the passive investors that like their ETF stocks, but the hedges don’t give a shit. They just want to short GME no matter the cost.   The mortgage allegory reminds me of say the 2008 crisis - I used to be a loan officer and the exotic sub prime mortgages were horse shit. You could qualify for a mortgage back then with a DTI (debt to income ratio) of 65%. For those unaware DTI is the ratio of your GROSS income vs the PITI of your home and all revolving and installment debt on your credit report. It does not factor in payments for utilities, food, gas. So they assume people can afford a house with the 35% of gross fucking income after their monthly debt is paid? No. Now the opposite is happening again. They deserve this for their insatiable greed and lack of compassion for anyone but themselves.   Hedgies have no cash and selling their income generating stocks to continue this fight. Eventually they’ll run out of those and will have no choice but to cover no matter the price. They fucking deserve it. From their ashes I hope we can build a market that is free and open without their influence and heavy shorting a float will be illegal. If I want to pay x dollars for a stock, that’s my business. Shorting is bullshit. Think a company is overvalued? Then close your position and find another fucking stock. The government should be appalled. Trying to BK a company not only puts thousands out of a job, but reduces the income tax stream from them to the gov’t. Not only that but now they’re on the govt payroll via unemployment. All this so they can profit off of destruction. Fuck. You. Long post I’m sorry.  TLDR: hedgies are going to burn for their atrocities.   My position: 914 shares of GME and one 3/5 $100 call. The shares I’d be willing to part with for say a minimum of 4 figures per share. Maybe 5 who knows? 42,069 per share has a nice ring to it. I like the stock and this isn’t financial advice. Hedge funds are cucks."
MOAT,1,32," **First, I am not a financial analyst or am I here to advise on what to do, here to just share my personal insights for discussion/entertainment purposes only. I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**  **Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**  Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.  *Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).  In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.  https: preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292  As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**  **Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**  Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.  Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.  Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)  **What is their current situation?**  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99  https: preview.redd.it/8ebzoj3h22k61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98cd896418f5f2a785d7ca9c42d5b3e1631db4c4  As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.  **Options/Puts**  https: preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598  Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.  **Volume**  Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.  https: preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e  https: preview.redd.it/p8pa354l22k61.jpg?width=485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d41890e943562c3cb6f15d8338e3dc77e2d3a98b  As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.  [  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https: preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)  Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.  [  ](https: preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)  **Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**  But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.  **Q4 report and team guidance**  So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**  **TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).  **TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  Positions – total of 5000 shares, had some before, bought majority on Friday, average is around $13.75.

On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.  I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.  Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**  It was time to get to work.  ****  **2.	The investigation**  I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.  1) [SNAP](https: investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https: investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https: investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.  2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.  *All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump.   *NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*  These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".  ****  **3.	Defining RAMBO**  As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**  I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https: esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.  **Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**  ****  **4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO**   **What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**  **My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference.   **5. So what am I saying?**  I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.  **Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**  [EPD](https: i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀   Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.  The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https: www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.  You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.  As always pick a good entry point.  [BIDU](https: i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀   **EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright   Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:  >BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China. A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.  Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.  [CRM](https: i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬   CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https: investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.  [ZNGA](https: i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) 🚀 😬   Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https: investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)  [NVDA](https: i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀   I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.  **Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble  ****  **TLDR**: Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.  I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates"

ESS,1,54," They're called options.   There are basically two types of options, call options and put options.    Someone who has 100 shares on a stock can write 1 option. They are essentially betting their 100 shares that the price will go down, in which case they write a call option, or go up so they write a put option. They do this because they want to receive the premium payment, which is the cost to buy the contract off them, and the interest of holding the option, but not have the contract exercised and for it to expire worthless.    Options have a strike price, an end date, and a premium.    The strike price is the price at which the options writer is willing to sell their share prices at x 100 no matter what the current stock price is. Have a strike price of $2 but current stock price is $900? Well it doesn't matter because your option says you must sell the underlying shares at $2. The premium is the cost to buy the contract that gives the purchaser the choice to exercise that contract before the end date and buy or sell those underlying shares at the strike price. The premium takes into account things like difference between the current stock price and the strike price, called intrinsic value, takes into account time for the option to move in the money, and volatility, how swingy the stock is (which means it could be in the money or out of the money on the same day, which makes it more likely to net a profit) and that's called implied volatility.    Finally the options have an end date which is the date the buyer of the option has to exercise the option and get those 100 shares.    So the writer places their bet and along comes a WSB retard who says ""I see your call option and I'll take that bet"" because unlike the writer they think the stock price will rise and become ITM before the expiry date. So they purchase the option paying the premium x 100 (because there are 100 shares) and they hold but don't exercise the option. The writer gets the premium and the WSB retard gets the call option and waits.    Important to remember but 99% of options are not exercised but rather the option itself is traded between traders because the premium is often worth more than exercising the stock, paying the strike price, and then selling that stock at the current share price.    So if the contract becomes ITM the option becomes more valuable especially if it has more time on it because the chance of the stock moving in the direction required becomes more likely. If its netting huge profit the WSB retard sells that option to someone else (or holds) and nets the profit of the premium.   If the option gets to its agreed end date and expires WORTHLESS (or Out of the money) then the WSB retard has only lost his initial investment of the premium x 100 and the options writer (who wanted it to expire worthless) keeps his underlying stock to sell more options.    Note that options can be written without owning the underlying stock and these are called naked options, and its dangerous and stupid as fuck to do. Otherwise they're known as covered options because if for some reason the WSB retard wants to exercise the option then the writer can cover it and give them the 100 shares.    Call option buyers think the price will go up.    Put option buyers think the price will go down.     Call option writers think the price will go down.   Put option writers think the price will go up.    Put options are a little more complicated but the basic understanding is that the person who owns the put option has the right to sell 100 shares at the strike price.    That's the basics."
TOK,1,1, I like TOKIF also but it's just not moving  . What should I do? My friend's
CRWD,1,9," # 🐸 is getting ready to leap.  This is my first DD post so I would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions I am making here. But I thing that JFrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why.  # What do they do?  Their main product is JFrog Artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries (runnable code) and it also serves as a mirror repository - local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer JFrog X-Ray that scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities). This is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory, Artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator, with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock, with X-Ray it also helps to ensure food safety.  **You may have heard of the Solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack. In my professional opinion, the toolset JFrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security.** That is why I am very much a Bullfrog 🐂🐸. If there is interest, I will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one, this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very, very well going forward.  # Company background  They were founded in 2008 and there main product has been Artifactory ever since. It has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope, Sonatype Nexus, but Artifactory is better and cheaper. Sonatype started as a plugin for Artifactory that does something similar to X-Ray before X-Ray existed, then they copycatted the Universal Repo, so JFrog hit back with X-Ray. I have used both of these products over the years (since 2013) and I have worked in environments without, Artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company Intellectual Property.  Their product is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook. These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe**. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have over 90% renewal rate of their customers.  They acquired Shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory. Though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are Open Source.  Their focus lately has been on offering a SaaS model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier. This should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic.  They went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as Snowflake.  # Financials  I am including a couple of Comps here based on the segment they operate in. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software Team collaboration. I picked them as a comp because I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.  * As a high growth software company, unsurprisingly their GAAP earnings are negative. Surprisingly to me though, they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability.    * FROG: -$0.1861    * CRWD: -$0.4763    * TEAM: -$4.9355 * Their market cap    * FROG: $4.9 B    * CRWD: $47.8 B    * TEAM: $59.4 B * Their forward P/E Ratio    * FROG: 615    * CRWD: 771    * TEAM: 173 * They don’t have any long term debt * Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3 * Their margin is over 80% * Revenue is growing 44% YOY  # Ownership  65% owned by insiders and institutions  Most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Index Fund) that own it.  Their final lockup was just released on 2/16 after their earnings and insiders have through 3/13 to sell before they go back into lockup. This is similar to what happened with Palantir recently, but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell.  # TL;DR  They have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry. They are well managed and have good financials as well.  # Positions  420 shares and 61 options, I am planning to get 8 more options on Monday. If you haven't guessed yet, I like the stock. You can check my post history to see some YOLO posts from earlier this week.

Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉  \------------  **Part 1: FINRA**  I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http: regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http: regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https: www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https: www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))  (Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)  There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.  The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.  **CAVEATS:**  * This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t * **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.  Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.  **Assumptions used:**  GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)  GME Total Shares: 69,750,000  https: preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74  https: preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571  The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http: finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!  https: preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030  \----------  **Part 2: Borrowing Shares**  Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.  The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https: iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https: iborrowdesk.com/about](https: iborrowdesk.com/about) ).  Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.  https: preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9  Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.  \----------  **Part 3: ETFs**  This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.  [https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https: www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)  Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.  https: preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274  [https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https: www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)  They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).  >“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”  If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).  NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF  \----------  **TLDR:**  THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!  **Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**  **PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)  \----------  Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https: www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https: www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https: www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.  \----------  For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:  ""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""  &#x200B;  https: preview.redd.it/xw8lu1l122k61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=644af631e8387d60cb475e33e67fcd1c66018b8d"

DRIP,1,2, And if you don’t DRIP the dividend you get $9.90 per share quarterly. I think 🤔
UUU,1,1, I made some money off DNN in the last uranium boom since then things have changed hands. Living in Moab it’s common knowledge about the uranium industry locally anyway. UUUU owns the only fully functional uranium mill in the US and the majority of the uranium mines in this area. If uranium prices go up they can be producing uranium ore within 30 days. Hope that helps

HUYA,1,1," This would be a other good WSB target... high short interest in an industry boomers know nothing about (esports and gaming live-streaming) that we all know is going to keep growing like crazy. Frankly, much better prospects for HUYA than GME.  Edit: they are like the Twitch and Discord of China, who has 4x as many gamers as the US... their market cap is about the same as GME but they have positive earnings."
